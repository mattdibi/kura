Advanced software frameworks, which abstract and isolate the developer from the complexity of the hardware and the networking sub-systems, re-define the development and re-usability of integrated hardware and software solutions. Eclipse Kura is an Eclipse IoT project that provides a platform for building IoT gateways. It is a smart application container that enables remote management of such gateways and provides a wide range of APIs for allowing you to write and deploy your own IoT application. Kura runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and leverages OSGi, a dynamic component system for Java, to simplify the process of writing reusable software building blocks. Kura APIs offer easy access to the underlying hardware including serial ports, GPS, watchdog, USB, GPIOs, I2C, etc. It also offer OSGI bundle to simplify the management of network configurations, the communication with IoT servers, and the remote management of the gateway. Kura components are designed as configurable OSGi Declarative Service exposing service API and raising events. While several Kura components are in pure Java, others are invoked through JNI and have a dependency on the Linux operating system. Kura comes with the following services: I/O Services Serial port access through javax.comm 2.0 API or OSGi I/O connection USB access and events through javax.usb, HID API, custom extensions Bluetooth access through javax.bluetooth or OSGi I/O connection Position Service for GPS information from an NMEA stream Clock Service for the synchronization of the system clock Kura API for GPIO/PWM/I2C/SPI access Data Services Store and forward functionality for the telemetry data collected by the gateway and published to remote servers. Policy-driven publishing system, which abstracts the application developer from the complexity of the network layer and the publishing protocol used. Eclipse Paho and its MQTT client provide the default messaging library used. Cloud Services Easy to use API layer for IoT application to communicate with a remote server. In addition to simple publish/subscribe, the Cloud Service API simplifies the implementation of more complex interaction flows like request/response or remote resource management. Allow for a single connection to a remote server to be shared across more than one application in the gateway providing the necessary topic partitioning. Configuration Service Leverage the OSGi specifications ConfigurationAdmin and MetaType to provide a snapshot service to import/export the configuration of all registered services in the container. Remote Management Allow for remote management of the IoT applications installed in Kura including their deployment, upgrade and configuration management. The Remote Management service relies on the Configuration Service and the Cloud Service. Networking Provide API for introspects and configure the network interfaces available in the gateway like Ethernet, Wifi, and Cellular modems. Watchdog Service Register critical components to the Watchdog Service, which will force a system reset through the hardware watchdog when a problem is detected. Web administration interface Offer a web-based management console running within the Kura container to manage the gateway. Drivers and Assets A unified model is introduced to simplify the communication with the devices attached to the gateway. The Driver encapsulates the communication protocol and its configuration parameters, while the Asset, which is generic across Drivers, models the information data channels towards the device. When an Asset is created, a Mirror of the device is automatically available for on-demand read and writes via Java APIs or via Cloud through remote messages. Wires Offers modular and visual data flow programming tool to define data collection and processing pipelines at the edge by simply selecting components from a palette and wiring them together. This way users can, for example, configure an Asset, periodically acquire data from its channels, store them in the gateway, filter or aggregate them using powerful SQL queries, and send the results to the Cloud.

The Eclipse Kapua Web Console provides the administration tools used for the management of the built-in services exposed by Kura. To remotely manage a device running Kura through the Eclipse Kapua Web Console, select the desired device from the Devices Table of the console and open the Configuration tab as shown in the screen capture below. Please refer to the Built-in Services section for a description of the available Services and their configuration parameters. Installation of a New Application As described in Application Management , a new application embedded in a deployment package can be deployed and configured using Eclipse Kapua Console. To do so, select a connected device and click on the Packages tab. Then, click on Install/Upgrade . The Install New Package window opens allowing the deployment package to be installed from an URL as shown in the screen capture below. Once installed, the new application parameters may be modified in the same way as the Built-in Services. Click on the Configuration tab to see the service that corresponds to your application. Snapshots As described in Snapshot Management , the overall Kura configuration, including the new installed applications, is stored in a snapshot xml file. The Eclipse Kapua Console also provides options to Download , Upload and Apply , or Rollback snapshots as shown in the screen capture below. Remote Command Execution from Eclipse Kapua Web Console The Eclipse Kapua Console provides the ability to run system commands directly on the device. Refer to Command Service for details on how to configure this service in Kura. It is also possible to send a script to execute using the File option of the Command tab in Eclipse Kapua Console as shown in the screen capture below. This script must be compressed into a zip file with the eventual associated resource files. Once the file is selected, click Execute . The zip file is sent embedded in an MQTT message on the device.

The Kura ExamplePublisher will be used as a reference. The application should bind itself to a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance, this can be done in different ways, such as using OSGi ServiceTracker s or by leveraging the Declarative Service layer. The recommended way to perform this operation is choosing the latter and allowing the user to customize the service references through component configuration. If the component metatype and definition are structured as described below, the Kura Web UI will show a dedicated widget in component configuration that helps the user to pick compatible CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instances. Write component definition The first step involves declaring the Publisher or Subscriber references in component definition: <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" activate= \"activate\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" modified= \"updated\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" configuration-policy= \"require\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <!-- If the component is configurable through the Kura ConfigurationService, it must expose a Service. --> <property name= \"service.pid\" type= \"String\" value= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\" /> </service> <reference name= \"CloudPublisher\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudPublisher\" unbind= \"unsetCloudPublisher\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.publisher.CloudPublisher\" /> <reference name= \"CloudSubscriber\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudSubscriber\" unbind= \"unsetCloudSubscriber\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.subscriber.CloudSubscriber\" /> </scr:component> The snipped above shows the definition of Kura ExamplePublisher, this component is capable of sending and receiving messages, and therefore defines two references, the first to a CloudPublisher and the second to a CloudSubscriber . In order to allow the user to customize the bindings at runtime, the target attribute of the references should not be specified at this point in component definition, as it will be set by the Web UI. Reference cardinality should be use the 0..1 or 0..n form, as it is not guaranteed that the references will point to a valid service instance during all the lifetime of the application component. For example, references can not be bound if the application has not been configured by the user yet or if the target service is missing. Create component metatype Application metatype should declare an AD for each Publisher/Subscriber reference declared in component definition: <MetaData xmlns= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/metatype/v1.2.0\" localization= \"en_us\" > <OCD id= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" name= \"ExamplePublisher\" description= \"Example of a Configuring Kura Application.\" > <!-- ... --> <AD id= \"CloudPublisher.target\" name= \"CloudPublisher Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Publisher used to publish messages to the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <AD id= \"CloudSubscriber.target\" name= \"CloudSubscriber Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Subscriber used to receive messages from the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <!-- ... --> </OCD> <Designate pid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" factoryPid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" > <Object ocdref= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> </Designate> </MetaData> It is important to respect the following rules for some of the AD attributes: id This attribute must have the following form: <reference name>.target where <reference name> should match the value of the name attribute of the corresponding reference in component definition. required must be set to true default must not be empty and must be a valid OSGi filter. The Web UI will renderer a dedicated widget for picking CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances: Write the bind/unbind methods in applicaiton code The last step involves defining some bind...() / unbind...() methods with a name that matches the values of the bind / unbind attributes of the references in component definition. public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } As stated above, since reference cardinality is declared as 0.. , the application must be prepared to handle the cases where references are not satisfied, and therefore CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances are not available. Publish a message If a CloudPublisher instance is bound, the application can publish messages using its publish() method: if ( nonNull ( this . cloudPublisher )) { KuraMessage message = new KuraMessage ( payload ); String messageId = this . cloudPublisher . publish ( message ); } Receiving messages using a CloudSubscriber In order to receive messages from a CloudSubscriber , the application must implement and attach a CloudSubscriberListener to it. This can be done for example during CloudSubscriber binding: public class ExamplePublisher implements CloudSubscriberListener , ... { ... public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { this . cloudSubscriber = cloudSubscriber ; this . cloudSubscriber . registerCloudSubscriberListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { this . cloudSubscriber . unregisterCloudSubscriberListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... this . cloudSubscriber = null ; } ... @Override public void onMessageArrived ( KuraMessage message ) { logReceivedMessage ( message ); } ... } The CloudSubscriber will invoke the onMessageArrived() method when new messages are received. Receiving connection state notifications If an application is interested in cloud connection status change events (connected, disconnected, etc), it can implement and attach a CloudConnectionListener to a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance. public class ExamplePublisher implements CloudConnectionListener , ... { ... public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { this . cloudPublisher = cloudPublisher ; this . cloudPublisher . registerCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { this . cloudPublisher . unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... this . cloudPublisher = null ; } public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { this . cloudSubscriber = cloudSubscriber ; ... this . cloudSubscriber . registerCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... this . cloudSubscriber . unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); this . cloudSubscriber = null ; } ... @Override public void onConnectionEstablished () { logger . info ( \"Connection established\" ); } @Override public void onConnectionLost () { logger . warn ( \"Connection lost!\" ); } @Override public void onDisconnected () { logger . warn ( \"On disconnected\" ); } ... } Receiving message delivery notifications If an application is interested in message confirmation events and the underlying cloud connection supports it, it can implement and attach a CloudDeliveryListener to a CloudPublisher instance. public class ExamplePublisher implements CloudDeliveryListener , ... { ... public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { this . cloudPublisher = cloudPublisher ; ... this . cloudPublisher . registerCloudDeliveryListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... this . cloudPublisher . registerCloudDeliveryListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); this . cloudPublisher = null ; } ... @Override public void onMessageConfirmed ( String messageId ) { logger . info ( \"Confirmed message with id: {}\" , messageId ); } ... } The CloudSubscriber will invoke the onMessageConfirmed() method when a published message is confirmed. In order to determine which message has been confirmed, the provided messageId can be compared with the id returned by the publish() call that published the message. Please note that if the underlying cloud connection is not able to provide message confirmation for the published message, the id returned by publish() will be null .","title":"Application Developer Guide"},{"location":"cloud-api/app-dev-guide/#application-developer-guide","text":"This guide will provide information on how an application developer can leverage the new Generic Cloud Services APIs, in order to be able to properly use the CloudPublisher/CloudSubscriber API, publish a message, being notified of message delivery and of connection status changes. The Kura ExamplePublisher will be used as a reference. The application should bind itself to a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance, this can be done in different ways, such as using OSGi ServiceTracker s or by leveraging the Declarative Service layer. The recommended way to perform this operation is choosing the latter and allowing the user to customize the service references through component configuration. If the component metatype and definition are structured as described below, the Kura Web UI will show a dedicated widget in component configuration that helps the user to pick compatible CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instances. Write component definition The first step involves declaring the Publisher or Subscriber references in component definition: <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" activate= \"activate\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" modified= \"updated\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" configuration-policy= \"require\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <!-- If the component is configurable through the Kura ConfigurationService, it must expose a Service. --> <property name= \"service.pid\" type= \"String\" value= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\" /> </service> <reference name= \"CloudPublisher\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudPublisher\" unbind= \"unsetCloudPublisher\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.publisher.CloudPublisher\" /> <reference name= \"CloudSubscriber\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudSubscriber\" unbind= \"unsetCloudSubscriber\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.subscriber.CloudSubscriber\" /> </scr:component> The snipped above shows the definition of Kura ExamplePublisher, this component is capable of sending and receiving messages, and therefore defines two references, the first to a CloudPublisher and the second to a CloudSubscriber . In order to allow the user to customize the bindings at runtime, the target attribute of the references should not be specified at this point in component definition, as it will be set by the Web UI. Reference cardinality should be use the 0..1 or 0..n form, as it is not guaranteed that the references will point to a valid service instance during all the lifetime of the application component. For example, references can not be bound if the application has not been configured by the user yet or if the target service is missing. Create component metatype Application metatype should declare an AD for each Publisher/Subscriber reference declared in component definition: <MetaData xmlns= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/metatype/v1.2.0\" localization= \"en_us\" > <OCD id= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" name= \"ExamplePublisher\" description= \"Example of a Configuring Kura Application.\" > <!-- ... --> <AD id= \"CloudPublisher.target\" name= \"CloudPublisher Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Publisher used to publish messages to the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <AD id= \"CloudSubscriber.target\" name= \"CloudSubscriber Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Subscriber used to receive messages from the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <!-- ... --> </OCD> <Designate pid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" factoryPid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" > <Object ocdref= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> </Designate> </MetaData> It is important to respect the following rules for some of the AD attributes: id This attribute must have the following form: <reference name>.target where <reference name> should match the value of the name attribute of the corresponding reference in component definition. required must be set to true default must not be empty and must be a valid OSGi filter. The Web UI will renderer a dedicated widget for picking CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances: Write the bind/unbind methods in applicaiton code The last step involves defining some bind...() / unbind...() methods with a name that matches the values of the bind / unbind attributes of the references in component definition. public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } As stated above, since reference cardinality is declared as 0.. , the application must be prepared to handle the cases where references are not satisfied, and therefore CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances are not available.

The following sections describe the services and how to configure them. The CloudService API is deprecated since Kura 4.0. The functionalities provided by CloudService are now provided by the CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager service interfaces. See the section describing the Kura 4.0 cloud connection model for more details. The DataService and MqttDataTrasport APIs are not deprecated in Kura 4.0. CloudService The CloudService provides an easy-to-use API layer for the M2M application to communicate with a remote server. It operates as a decorator for the DataService, providing add-on features over the management of the transport layer. In addition to simple publish/subscribe, the CloudService API simplifies the implementation of more complex interaction flows like request/response or remote resource management. The CloudService abstracts the developers from the complexity of the transport protocol and payload format used in the communication. The CloudService allows a single connection to a remote server to be shared across more than one application in the gateway providing the necessary topic partitioning. Its functions include: Adds application topic prefixes to allow for a single remote server connection to be shared across applications. Defines a payload data model and provides default encoding/decoding serializers. Publishes life-cycle messages when the device and applications start and stop. To use this service, select the CloudServices option located in the System area and select the CloudService tab as shown in the screen capture below. The CloudService provides the following configuration parameters: device.display-name - defines the device display name given by the system. (Required field.) device.custom-name - defines the custom device display name if the device.display-name parameter is set to \"Custom\". topic.control-prefix - defines the topic prefix for system messages. encode.gzip - defines if the message payloads are sent compressed. republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.gps.lock - when set to true, forces a republish of the MQTT Birth Certificate when a GPS correct position lock is received. The device is then registered with its real coordinates. (Required field.) republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect - when set to true, forces a republish of the MQTT Birth Certificate when the service receives a modem detection event. (Required field.) enable.default.subscriptions - when set to true, the gateway will not be remotely manageable. birth.cert.policy - specify the birth certificate policy. The options are Disable publishing , Publish birth on connect and Publish birth on connect and reconnect . payload.encoding - Specify the message payload encoding. The possible options are Kura Protobuf and Simple JSON . DataService The DataService provides the ability to connect to a remote broker, publish messages, subscribe to topics, receive messages on the subscribed topics, and disconnect from the remote message broker. The DataService delegates to the MqttDataTransport service the implementation of the transport protocol that is used to interact with the remote server. The DataService also adds the capability of storing published messages in a persistent store function and sending them over the wire at a later time. The purpose of this feature is to relieve service users from implementing their own persistent store. Service users may publish messages independently on the DataService connection status. In order to overcome the potential latencies introduced by buffering messages, the DataService allows a priority level to be assigned for each published message. Depending on the store configuration, there are certain guarantees that stored messages are not lost due to sudden crashes or power outages. To use this service, select the DataService option located in the System area and select the CloudService tab as shown in the screen capture below. The DataService offers methods and configuration options to manage the connection to the remote server including the following (all required) parameters described below. connect.auto-on-startup - when set to true, the service tries to auto-connect to the remote server on start-up and restore the connection every time the device is disconnected. These attempts are made at the frequency defined in the connect.retry-interval parameter until the connection is established. disconnect.quiesce-timeout - allows the delivery of in-flight messages to be completed before disconnecting from the broker when a disconnection from the broker is being forced. store.housekeeper-interval - defines the interval in seconds used to run the Data Store housekeeper task. store.purge-age - defines the age in seconds of completed messages (either published with QoS = 0 or confirmed with QoS > 0) after which they are deleted (minimum 5). store.capacity - defines the maximum number of messages persisted in the Data Store. in-flight-messages parameters - define the management of messages that have been published and not yet confirmed, including: in-flight-messages.republish-on-new-session in-flight-messages.max-number in-flight-messages.congestion-timeout MqttDataTransport The MqttDataTransport service provides the ability to connect to a remote broker, publish messages, subscribe to topics, receive messages on the subscribed topics, and disconnect from the remote message broker. To use this service, select the MqttDataTransport option located in the System area and select the CloudService tab as shown in the screen capture below. The MqttDataTransport service provides the following configuration parameters: broker-url - defines the URL of the MQTT broker to connect to. (Required field.) topic.context.account-name - defines the name of the account to which the device belongs. username and password - define the username and password that have been assigned to the device by the account administrator (generally username is account-name_broker). (Required field.) client-id - defines the identifier of the MQTT client representing the device when connecting to the MQTT broker. If left empty, it is automatically determined by the client software as the MAC address of the main network interface (in general numbers and uppercase letters without ':'). This identifier has to be unique within your account. keep-alive - defines the \"keep alive\" interval measured in seconds. It specifies the maximum amount of time that should pass without communication between the client and the server. The client will ensure that at least one message travels across the network within each keep alive period. In the absence of a data-related message during this time period, the client will send a very small MQTT \"ping\" message that the server will acknowledge. The keep alive interval enables the client to detect when the server is no longer available without having to wait for the long TCP/IP timeout. (Required field.) timeout - sets the timeout used for all interactions with the MQTT broker. (Required field.) clean-session - controls the behavior of both the client and the server at the time of connect and disconnect. When this parameter is set to true, the state information is discarded at connect and disconnect; when set to false, the state information is maintained. (Required field.) lwt parameters - define the MQTT \"Last Will and Testament\" (LWT) settings for the client. In the event that the client unexpectedly loses its connection to the server, the server publishes the LWT message (lwt.payload) to the LWT topic on behalf of the client. This allows other clients (subscribed to the LWT topic) to be made aware that the client has disconnected. LWT parameters that may be configured include: lwt.topic lwt.payload lwt.qos lwt.retain in-flight.persistence - defines the storage type where in-flight messages are persisted across reconnections. They may be stored in memory, or in a file on the disk. (Required field.) protocol-version - defines the MQTT Protocol version to be used.

As reference, this guide will use the Eclipse IoT WG namespace implementation bundle available here Implement CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager In order to leverage the new APIs, and be managed by the Kura Web UI, the Cloud Connection implementation bundle must implement CloudEndpont and, if log-lived connections are supported, the CloudConnectionManager interface must be implemented as well. The ending class should be something as follows: public class CloudConnectionManagerImpl implements CloudConnectionManager , CloudEndpoint , ... { @Override public boolean isConnected () { ... } @Override public void connect () throws KuraConnectException { ... } @Override public void disconnect () { ... } @Override public Map < String , String > getInfo () { ... } @Override public void registerCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ) { ... } @Override public void unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ) { ... } } A corresponding component definition should be provided in the OSGI-INF folder exposing the implementation of CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager interfaces. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" activate= \"activate\" configuration-policy= \"require\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" modified= \"updated\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.eclipseiot.mqtt.ConnectionManager\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.internal.cloudconnection.eclipseiot.mqtt.cloud.CloudConnectionManagerImpl\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\" /> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudConnectionManager\" /> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudEndpoint\" /> <!-- ... --> </service> <!-- ... --> <property name= \"kura.ui.service.hide\" type= \"Boolean\" value= \"true\" /> <property name= \"kura.ui.factory.hide\" type= \"String\" value= \"true\" /> </scr:component> In order to be fully compliant with the Web UI requirements, the CloudConnection component definition should provide two properties kura.ui.service.hide and kura.ui.factory.hide to hide the component from the left side part of the UI dedicated to display the services list. Implement the CloudConnectionFactory interface The CloudConnectionFactory is responsible to manage the cloud connection instance lifecycle by creating the CloudEndpoint instance and all the required services needed to publish or receive messages from the cloud platform. As a reference, please have a look at the CloudConnectionFactory defined for the Eclipse IoT WG namespace implementation. In particular, the getFactoryPid() method returns the PID of the CloudEndpoint factory. The createConfiguration() method receives a PID that will be used for the instantiation of the CloudEndpoint and for all the related services required to communicate with the cloud platform. In the example above, the factory creates the CloudEnpoint, and a DataService and MqttDataTransport instances internally needed to communicate with a remote cloud platform. As can be seen here , the CloudEndpoint instance configuration is enriched with the reference to the CloudConnectionFactory that generated it. This step is required by the Web UI in order to properly relate the instances with the corresponding factories. The deleteConfiguration() method deletes from the framework the CloudEndpoint instance identified by the PID passed as argument and all the related services. In the Eclipse IOT WG example, it not only deletes the CloudEndpoint instance but also the corresponding DataService and MqttDataTransport instances. The getStackComponentsPids() method return a List of String that represent the kura.service.pid of the configurable components that are part of a Cloud Connection instance. This method is used by the Web UI to get the list of configurable components that need to be displayed to the end user. The getManagedCloudConnectionPids() method will return the list of kura.service.pid of all the CloudEndpoints managed by the factory.

Motivations Before Kura 4.0, Cloud APIs were quite tied to Kapua messaging conventions and to the MQTT protocol. Defining custom stacks that support other cloud platforms was possible, but the resulting implementations were affected by the following limitations: The legacy APIs assume that the underlying messaging protocol is MQTT. This assumption spans across all API layers, from the low level MQTTDataTrasport to the high level CloudClient . This makes quite difficult to implement cloud stacks that use other protocols like AMQP or HTTP. The CloudClient API, which was the recommended way for applications to interface with a cloud stack, enforce the following MQTT topic structure: #account-name/#device-id/#app-id/<app-topic> This topic hierarchy, which is Kapua related, might be too restrictive or too loose for other cloud platforms, for example: The Eclipse IoT working group namespace allows authenticated devices to omit the accont-name and device-id parameters in the topic. Moreover, telemetry, alert and event message topics must start respectively the t/ , a/ and e/ prefixes. Adhering to this specification is not possible for a cloud stack that implements the legacy APIs. The AWS cloud platform allows publishing on virtually any topic, using a CloudClient would be quite restrictive in this case. A way for overcoming this limitation for an application might be using the DataService layer directly, adversely affecting portability. The Cumulocity cloud platform allows publishing only on a limited set of topics, and most of the application generated information is placed in the payload encoded in CSV. Using CloudClient in this case makes difficult for the cloud stack to enforce that the messages are published on the correct topics. Moreover, the cloud stack in this case must also convert from KuraPayload to CSV, this can be currently achieved only by introducing rigid conversion rules, that might not be enough to support all message formats. Applications that use the current APIs are not portable across cloud platforms. For example if an appliaction intends to publish on Cumulocity or AWS, it should be probably aware of the underlying cloud platform. Concepts The main interfaces of the new set of APIs and their interactions are depicted in the diagram below: As shown in the above diagram new APIs introduce the concept of Cloud Connection , a set of related services that allow to manage the communication to/from a remote cloud platform. The services that compose a Cloud Connection can implement the following cloud-specific interfaces: CloudEndpoint (required): Each Cloud Connection is identified by a single instance of CloudEndpoint that implements low level specificities for the communication with the remote cloud platform. CloudConnectionManager (optional): Exposes methods that allow to manage long-lived connections. The implementor of CloudEndpoint can implement this interface as well if the cloud platform support long-lived connections (for example by using the MQTT protocol). RequestHandlerRegistry (optional): Manages the command and control functionalities if supported by the cloud platform. CloudPublisher (optional): Allows applications to publish messages to the cloud platform in a portable way. CloudSubscriber (optional): Allows applications to receive messages from the cloud platform in a portable way. CloudConnectionFactory (required): Manages the lifecycle of Cloud Connections. A Cloud Connection can also include services that do not provide any of the interfaces above but compose the internal implementation. CloudEndpoint Every Cloud Connection must contain a single CloudEndpoint instance. The kura.service.pid of the CloudEndpoint identifies the whole Cloud Connection. The CloudEndpoint provides some low level methods that can be used to interact with the remote cloud platform. For example the interface provides the publish() and subscribe() methods that allow to publish or receive messages from the cloud platform in form of KuraMessage s. Those methods are designed for internal use and are not intended to be used by end-user applications. The format of the KuraMessage provided to/received from a CloudEndpoint is implementation specific: the CloudEndpoint expects some properties to be set in the KuraMessage to be able to correctly publish a message (e.g. MQTT topic). These properties are specified by the particular CloudEndpoint , and should be documented by the implementor. The recommended way for applications to publish and receive messages involves using the Publisher and Subscriber APIs described below. If an application directly uses the methods above, it will lose portability and will be tied to the specific Cloud Connection implementation. CloudConnectionManager If the messaging protocol implemented by a Cloud Connection supports long-lived connection, then its CloudEndpoint can also implement and provide the CloudConnectionManager interface. This interface exposes some methods that can be used to manage the connection like connect() , disconnect() and isConnected() ; it also supports monitoring connection state using the CloudConnectionListener interface. Publishers and Subscribers The limitations of the current model described above are addressed by the introduction of the CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber APIs, that replace the CloudClient as the recommended interface between applications and cloud stacks. CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber are service interfaces defined as follows: public interface CloudPublisher { public String publish ( KuraMessage message ) throws KuraException ; public void registerCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); public void unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); public void registerCloudDeliveryListener ( CloudDeliveryListener cloudDeliveryListener ); public void unregisterCloudDeliveryListener ( CloudDeliveryListener cloudDeliveryListener ); } public interface CloudSubscriber { public void registerCloudSubscriberListener ( CloudSubscriberListener listener ); public void unregisterCloudSubscriberListener ( CloudSubscriberListener listener ); public void registerCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); public void unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); } CloudPublisher The CloudPublisher interface should be used by applications for publishing messages using the single publish() method. This method accepts a KuraMessage which is basically a KuraPayload that can be enriched with metadata. The main difference with the CloudClient APIs is that the publish() method does not require the application to specify any information related to message destinations. This allows to write portable applications that are unaware of the low level details of the destination cloud platform, such as the message format and the transport protocol. CloudSubscriber An application designed to receive messages from the cloud must now attach a listener ( CloudSubscriberListener ) to a CloudSubscriber instance. In this case, the message source cannot be specified by the application but is defined by the subscriber instance, in the same way as the CloudPublisher defines destination for published messages. The low level details necessary for message delivery and reception (e.g. the MQTT topic and the conversion between KuraMessage and the message format used on the wire) are managed by the publisher/subscriber, typically these details are stored in the service configuration. While in the previous model an application was responsible to actively obtain a CloudClient instance from a CloudService , now the relation between the application and a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance is represented as an OSGi service reference. Applications should allow the user to modify this reference in configuration, making it easy to switch between different cloud publisher/subscriber instances and different cloud platforms. Publisher/subscriber instances are now typically instantiated and configured by the end user using the Web UI. Publisher/subscriber instances are related to a CloudEnpoint instance using an OSGi service reference encoded in well known configuration property specified in the APIs ( CloudConnectionConstants.CLOUD_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_PID_PROP_NAME ). This allows the user to create those instances in a dedicated section of the Web UI. Command and control Another field in which the current Kura cloud related APIs can be generalized is related to command and control. In the previous model this aspect was covered by the Cloudlet APIs that are now replaced by RequestHandler APIs Legacy Cloudlet implementations are defined by extending a base class, Cloudlet , which takes care of handling the invocation of the doGet() , doPut() , doPost() ... methods, and of correlating request and response messages. Messages were sent and received through a CloudClient . More explicitly, Cloudlet only works with control topics whose structure is $EDC/<account-name>/<device-id>/<app-id>/<method>/<resource-path> and also expects the identifier of the sender and the correlation identifier in the KuraPayload . In the previous model, there is no way for a cloud stack implementor to customize the aspects above, which are hardcoded in the Cloudlet base class. The new model delegates these aspects to some component of the cloud stack, and requires applications that want to support command and control to register themselves as RequestHandler to a RequestHandlerRegistry instance. In order to ease porting old applications to the new model, some of the concepts of the old Cloudlet APIs are still present, this can be seen by looking at the RequestHandler interface definition: public interface RequestHandler { public KuraMessage doGet ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPut ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPost ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doDel ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doExec ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; } A RequestHandler invocation involves the following parameters: Request parameters: method : (GET, PUT, POST, DEL, EXEC) that identifies the RequestHandler method to be called request message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the KuraMessage . resources : A List<String> of positional parameters available under the well known args key in the provided KuraMessage properties. Response parameters: response message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the returned KuraMessage . status : A numeric code reporting operation completion state, determined as follows: 200, if RequestHandler methods returns without throwing exceptions. 400, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == BAD_REQUEST 404, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == NOT_FOUND 500, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with other error codes. exception message : The message of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. exception stack trace : The stack trace of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. The parameters above are the same involved in current Cloudlet calls. The request id and requester client id parameters are no longer part of the API, because are related to the to the way Kapua correlates requests and response. In the new API, request and response identifiers are not specified and not forwarded to the Cloudlet, this allows the CloudletService implementation to adopt the platform specific conventions for message correlation. The Cloudlet parameters must be present in the request and response messages encoded in some format. A user that intends to call a Kura Cloudlet, for example through platform-specific REST APIs must be aware of these parameters. The user must supply request parameters in request message and must be able to extract response data from received message. The actual encoding of these parameters inside the messages depends on the particular platform. The fact that set of Cloudlet parameters are roughly the same involved in current Cloudlet calls allows existing Cloudlet based applications to continue to work without changes to the protocol. Cloud Connection lifecycle CloudEndpoint instance lifecycle is managed by a CloudConnectionFactory instance. A cloud connection implementor must register a CloudConnectionFactory instance in the framework that is responsible of creating and destroying the CloudEndpoint instances. The CloudConnectionFactory will be typically invoked by the Web UI, and is defined as follows: public interface CloudConnectionFactory { public static final String KURA_CLOUD_CONNECTION_FACTORY_PID = \"kura.cloud.connection.factory.pid\" ; public String getFactoryPid (); public void createConfiguration ( String pid ) throws KuraException ; public List < String > getStackComponentsPids ( String pid ) throws KuraException ; public void deleteConfiguration ( String pid ) throws KuraException ; public Set < String > getManagedCloudConnectionPids () throws KuraException ; } The createConfiguration() and deleteConfiguration() methods are responsible of creating/destroying a CloudEndpoint instance, specified by the provided kura.service.pid , and all the related services. The getManagedCloudConnectionPids() returns the set of kura.service.pid managed by the factory. The getStackComponentsPids(String pid) returns the list of the kura.service.pid s of the ConfigurableComponent s that are associated with the CloudEndpoint with the specified pid. The Web Ui will render the configuration of those components in separated tabs, in the dedicated CloudConnections section. Backwards compatibility In order to ease the transition to the new model, legacy APIs like CloudService and CloudClient are still supported in Kura 4.0.0, even if deprecated. The default Kapua oriented CloudService implementation is still available and can be used by legacy applications without changes. The default CloudService instance in Kura 4.0 also implements the new CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager interfaces.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#overview","text":"This section describes the new cloud related concepts and APIs introduced in Kura 4.0.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#motivations","text":"Before Kura 4.0, Cloud APIs were quite tied to Kapua messaging conventions and to the MQTT protocol.

Applications should allow the user to modify this reference in configuration, making it easy to switch between different cloud publisher/subscriber instances and different cloud platforms. Publisher/subscriber instances are now typically instantiated and configured by the end user using the Web UI. Publisher/subscriber instances are related to a CloudEnpoint instance using an OSGi service reference encoded in well known configuration property specified in the APIs ( CloudConnectionConstants.CLOUD_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_PID_PROP_NAME ). This allows the user to create those instances in a dedicated section of the Web UI.","title":"CloudSubscriber"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#command-and-control","text":"Another field in which the current Kura cloud related APIs can be generalized is related to command and control. In the previous model this aspect was covered by the Cloudlet APIs that are now replaced by RequestHandler APIs Legacy Cloudlet implementations are defined by extending a base class, Cloudlet , which takes care of handling the invocation of the doGet() , doPut() , doPost() ... methods, and of correlating request and response messages. Messages were sent and received through a CloudClient . More explicitly, Cloudlet only works with control topics whose structure is $EDC/<account-name>/<device-id>/<app-id>/<method>/<resource-path> and also expects the identifier of the sender and the correlation identifier in the KuraPayload . In the previous model, there is no way for a cloud stack implementor to customize the aspects above, which are hardcoded in the Cloudlet base class. The new model delegates these aspects to some component of the cloud stack, and requires applications that want to support command and control to register themselves as RequestHandler to a RequestHandlerRegistry instance. In order to ease porting old applications to the new model, some of the concepts of the old Cloudlet APIs are still present, this can be seen by looking at the RequestHandler interface definition: public interface RequestHandler { public KuraMessage doGet ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPut ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPost ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doDel ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doExec ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; } A RequestHandler invocation involves the following parameters: Request parameters: method : (GET, PUT, POST, DEL, EXEC) that identifies the RequestHandler method to be called request message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the KuraMessage . resources : A List<String> of positional parameters available under the well known args key in the provided KuraMessage properties. Response parameters: response message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the returned KuraMessage . status : A numeric code reporting operation completion state, determined as follows: 200, if RequestHandler methods returns without throwing exceptions. 400, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == BAD_REQUEST 404, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == NOT_FOUND 500, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with other error codes. exception message : The message of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. exception stack trace : The stack trace of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. The parameters above are the same involved in current Cloudlet calls. The request id and requester client id parameters are no longer part of the API, because are related to the to the way Kapua correlates requests and response. In the new API, request and response identifiers are not specified and not forwarded to the Cloudlet, this allows the CloudletService implementation to adopt the platform specific conventions for message correlation. The Cloudlet parameters must be present in the request and response messages encoded in some format. A user that intends to call a Kura Cloudlet, for example through platform-specific REST APIs must be aware of these parameters. The user must supply request parameters in request message and must be able to extract response data from received message. The actual encoding of these parameters inside the messages depends on the particular platform. The fact that set of Cloudlet parameters are roughly the same involved in current Cloudlet calls allows existing Cloudlet based applications to continue to work without changes to the protocol.","title":"Command and control"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#cloud-connection-lifecycle","text":"CloudEndpoint instance lifecycle is managed by a CloudConnectionFactory instance. A cloud connection implementor must register a CloudConnectionFactory instance in the framework that is responsible of creating and destroying the CloudEndpoint instances.

Prerequisites In order to connect a device to Amazon AWS IoT Kura version 1.3 or greater is required. An Amazon AWS account is also needed. Device registration The first step involves the registration of the new device on AWS, this operation can be done using the AWS Web Console or with the AWS CLI command line tool, in this guide the Web based console will be used. 1. Access the AWS IoT management console. This can be done by logging in the AWS console and selecting IoT Core from the services list, in the Internet of Things section. 2. Create a default policy for the device. This step involves creating a default policy for the new device, skip if an existing policy is already available. Access the main screen of the console and select Secure -> Policies from the left side menu and then press the Create button, in the top right area of the screen. Fill the form as follows and then press the Create button: Action -> iot:Connect, iot:Publish, iot:Subscribe, iot:Receive, iot:UpdateThingShadow, iot:GetThingShadow, iot:DeleteThingShadow Resource ARN -> * Effect -> Allow This will create a policy that allows a device to connect to the platform, publish/subscribe on any topic and manage its thing shadow . 3. Register a new device. Devices on the AWS IoT platform are called things , in order to register a new thing select Manage -> Things from the left side menu and then press the Create button, in the top right section of the screen. Select Create a single thing . Enter a name for the new device and then press the Next button, from now on kura-gateway will be used as the device name. 4. Create a new certificate for the device. The AWS IoT platform uses SSL mutual authentication, for this reason it is necessary to download a public/private key pair for the device and a server certificate. Click on Create certificate to quickly generate a new certificate for the new device. Certificates can be managed later on by clicking on Secure -> Certificates , in the left part of the console. 5. Download the device SSL keys. You should see a screen like the following: Download the 3 files listed in the table and store them in a safe place, they will be needed later, also copy the link to the root CA for AWS IoT in order to be able to retrieve it later from the device. Press the Activate button, and then on Attach a policy . 6. Assign the default policy to the device. Select the desired policy and then click on Register thing . A policy can also be attached to a certificate later on perforiming the following steps: Enter the device configuration section, by clicking on Manage -> Things and then clicking on the newly created device. Click on Security on the left panel and then click on the certificate entry (it is identified by an hex code), select Policies in the left menu, you should see this screen: Click on Actions in the top left section of the page and then click on Attach policy , select the default policy previously created and then press the Attach button. Device configuration The following steps should be performed on the device, this guide is based on Kura 3.1.0 version and has been tested on a Raspberry PI 3. 7. Create a Java keystore on the device. The first step for using the device keys obtained at the previous step is to create a new Java keystore containing the Root Certificate used by the Amazon IoT platform, this can be done executing the following commands on the device: sudo mkdir /opt/eclipse/kura/security cd /opt/eclipse/kura/security curl https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem > /tmp/root-CA.pem sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias aws -file /tmp/root-CA.pem -keystore cacerts.ks -storepass changeit If the last command reports that the certificate already exist in the system-wide store type yes to proceed. The code above will generate a new keystore with changeit as password, change it if needed. 8. Configure the SSL parameters using the Kura Web UI. Open the Kura Web Console and enter select the Settings entry in the left side menu and then click on SSL Configuration , you should see this screen: Change the Keystore path parameter to /opt/eclipse/kura/security/cacerts.ks if needed. Change the settings in the form to match the screen above, set Default protocol to TLSv1.2 , enter changeit as Keystore Password (or the password defined at step 7). Warning Steps from 8.2 to 8.6 will not work on Kura 3.2.0 due to a known issue . On this version, private key and device certificate need to be manually added to the keystore using the command line. If you are running Kura 3.2.0, proceed with step 8.7. Open the Kura Web Console and enter select the Settings entry in the left side menu and then click on Device SSL Certificate , you should see this screen: Enter aws-ssl in the Storage Alias field. The private key needs to be converted to the PKCS8 format, this step can be performed executing the following command on a Linux or OSX based machine: openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key -out outKey.pem -nocrypt where xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key is the file containing the private key downloaded at step 4. Paste the contents of the obtained outKey.pem in the \"Private Key\" field. Paste the contents of xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt in the Certificate field. You should see a screen like this Click the Apply button to confirm. Kura 3.2.0 only - manually import device certificate and private key into keystore. On the host machine, open a terminal window in the folder containing the files downloaded at step 5 and execute the following command: openssl pkcs12 -export -in xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt -inkey xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key -name aws-ssl -out aws-ssl.p12 where xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt is the original certificate downloaded from AWS and xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key is the private key. The command will ask for a password, define a new password. Copy the obtained aws-ssl.p12 file to the device into the /tmp folder using scp: scp ./aws-ssl.p12 pi@<device-address>:/tmp Replacing <device-address> with the hostname or ip address of the device. Open a ssh connection to the device and enter the following command: sudo keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass changeit -destkeystore /opt/eurotech/esf/security/cacerts.ks -srckeystore /tmp/aws-ssl.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 The command will ask for a password, enter the password defined when creating the aws-ssl.p12 file. Restart Kura to reload the keystore. 9. Setup a new cloud connection Click on Cloud Connections in the left panel, and setup a new cloud connection Click on the New Connection button at the top of the page and set the following parameters in the dialog: Cloud Connection Factory PID -> org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService Cloud Connection Service PID -> org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService-AWS Press the Create button to confirm and then select the newly created CloudService instance from the list. Set the broker URL in the MqttDataTransport-AWS tab, it can be obtained from the AWS IoT Web Console clicking on the Settings entry in the bottom left section of the page, the URL will look like the following: a1rm1xxxxxxxxx.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The mqtts protocol must be used, the value for the broker-url field derived from the URL above is the following: mqtts://a1rm1xxxxxxxxx.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883/ Clear the value of the username and password fields. Set a value for the topic.context.account-name and client-id . Assign an arbitrary account name to topic.context.account-name (for example aws-test ), this will be used by the CloudClient instances for building the topic structure. Enter the thing name in the client-id field (in this example kura-gateway ). In order for the previously added keys to be used for the SSL connection with the broker enter the Storage Alias defined in step 8.2 (e.g aws-ssl ) as value for the ssl.certificate.alias field. The setting lwt.topic under MqttDataTransport-AWS needs to be updated as well by entering a value not containing the $ character. This is required because of the fact that AWS IoT does not support topic names starting with $ (except for the $aws/ hierarchy). Press the Apply button in the top left section to commit the changes to the MqttDataTransport-AWS . Enter a name without the $ character for the topic.control-prefix setting in the CloudService-AWS tab, for example aws-control . The Kura CloudService uses some well-known topics to allow remote device management and to report device state information, this features are not supported by default by AWS IoT, the following settings can be applied in the CloudService-AWS tab in order to avoid sending unnecessary messages: republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.gps.lock -> false republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect -> false enable.default.subscriptions -> false birth.cert.policy -> Disable publishing Click the Apply button to save the changes. 10.

When doing so, Kura applications can send device-to-cloud messages. More information on the Azure IoT Hub and its support for the MQTT protocol can be found here . This document outlines how to configure and connect a Kura application to the Azure IoT Hub. Get Azure IoT Hub information In order to properly configure Kura to connect to IoT Hub, some information are needed. You will need the hostname of the Azure IoT Hub, referred below as {iothubhostname} , the Id and the SAS Token of the device, referred as {device_id} and {device_SAS_token} . The hostname is listed on the \"Overview\" tab on the IoT Hub main page, while the device ID is shown on the \"Device Explorer\" tab. Finally, the SAS token can be generated using the iothub-explorer application that can be found here . To install the application, type on a shell: npm install -g iothub-explorer Then start a new session on your IoT Hub instance (it will expire in 1 hour): iothub-explorer login \"{your-connection-string}\" where {your-connection-string} is the connection string of your IoT Hub instance. It can be found on the \"Shared access policies\" tab under \"Settings\". Select the \"iothubowner\" policy and a tab will appear with the \"Connection string\u2014primary key\" option. Then list your devices: iothub-explorer list and get the SAS token for the {device-name} device: iothub-explorer sas-token { device-name } Be aware that the SAS token will expire in 1 hour by default, but using \"-d\" option it is possible to set a custom expiration time. SSL certificates In order to connect to your IoT Hub instance, Kura should trust the remote broker through a SSL certificate. The simpler way to get the IotHub certificate is to run the following command on a shell: openssl s_client -showcerts -tls1 -connect { iothubhostname } :8883 The result is the SSL certificate chain. Copy all the certificates in the format: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE----- and paste them in to the \"Server SSL Certificate\" tab under \"Settings\" in Kura. Then click the Apply button and restart Kura to update the keystore. Configuring a Kura Cloud Stack for Azure IoT Hub The Kura Gateway Administrative Console exposes all services necessary to configure a connection to the Azure IoT Hub. You can follow the steps outlined below to configure the connection to the Azure IoT Hub. The first step is to create a new Kura Cloud stack.

If enabled, it tries to update the system date and time using a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. NTP can use NTS as authentication mechanism through chrony. Service Configuration To manage the system date and time, select the ClockService option located in the Services area as shown in the screen capture below. The ClockService provides the following configuration parameters: enabled : sets whether or not this service is enabled or disabled (Required field). clock.set.hwclock : defines if the hardware clock of the gateway must be synced after the system time is set. If enabled, the service calls the Linux command hwclock --utc --systohc . clock.provider : specifies one among Java NTP client (java-ntp), Linux chrony command (chrony-advanced), Linux ntpdate command (ntpd) (Required field). If chrony-advanced is used, Kura will not change system and/or hardware clock directly, delegating these operations to chrony. clock.ntp.host : sets a valid NTP server host address. clock.ntp.port : sets a valid NTP port number. clock.ntp.timeout : specifies the NTP timeout in milliseconds. clock.ntp.max-retry : defines the number of retries when a sync fails (retry at every minute). Subsequently, the next retry occurs on the next refresh interval. clock.ntp.retry.interval : defines the interval in seconds between each retry when a sync fails. If the clock.ntp.refresh-interval parameter is less than zero, there is no update. If the clock.ntp.refresh-interval parameter is equal to zero, there is only one try at startup (Required field). clock.ntp.refresh-interval : defines the frequency (in seconds) at which the service tries to sync the clock. Note that at the start of Kura, when the ClockService is enabled, it tries to sync the clock every minute until it is successful. After a successful sync, this operation is performed at the frequency defined by this parameter. If the value is less than zero, there is no update. If the value is equal to zero, syncs only once at startup. chrony.advanced.config : specifies the content of the chrony configuration file. If this field is left blank, the default system configuration will be used. To obtain the hardware clock synchronization the directive rtcsync could be used. The rtcsync directive provides the hardware clock synchronization made by the linux kernel every 11 minutes. For further information reference the chrony website .

If this happens and no counter action has been taken in the chrony configuration file, the risk is that the gateway will be unable to synchronise again its date and therefore will not be able to connect to the cloud and/or be fully operational. A possible way to prevent this issue is to temporary disable the certificate verification using the directive nocerttimecheck. This directory will disable the security checks of the activation and expiration times of certificates for the specified number of clock updates and should be used with caution due to the important security implications . As reported by the official Chrony documentation , disabling the time checks has important security implications and should be used only as a last resort, preferably with a minimal number of trusted certificates. The default value is 0, which means the time checks are always enabled. An example of the directive is nocerttimecheck 1 This would disable the time checks until the clock is updated for the first time, assuming the first update corrects the clock and later checks can work with correct time.

Currently, the only officially supported engine is Docker. Starting the Service To use this service select the ContainerOrchestrationService option located in the Services area. The ContainerOrchestrationService provides the following parameters: Enabled --activates the service when set to true Container Engine Host URL --provides a string that tells the service where to find the container engine (best left to the default value). Creating your first container. To create a container, select the + icon (Create a new component) under services . A popup dialogue box will appear. In the field Factory select org.eclipse.kura.container.provider.ContainerInstance from the drop-down. Then, using the Name field, enter the name of the container you wish to create and Finally press submit to create the component. After pressing submit, a new component will be added under the services tab, with the name that was selected in the dialogue. Select this component to finish configuring the container. Configuring the container To begin configuring the container, look under Services and select the item which has the name set in the previous step. Containers may be configured using the following fields: Enabled - When true, the service will create the defined container. When false the API will not create the container or will destroy the container if already running. Image Name - Describes the image that will be used to create the container. Remember to ensure that the selected image supports the architecture of the host machine, or else the container will not be able to start. Image Tag - Describes the version of the container image that will be used to create the container. Authentication Registry URL - URL for an alternative registry to pull images from. (If the field is left blank, credentials will be applied to Docker-Hub). Please see the Authenticated Registries document for more information about connecting to different popular registries. Authentication Username - Describes the username to access the container registry entered above. Password - Describes the password to access the alternative container registry. Image Download Retries - Describes the number of retries the framework will attempt to pull the image before giving up. Image Download Retry Interval - Describes the amount of time the framework will wait before attempting to pull the image again. Image Download Timeout - Describes the amount of time the framework will let the image download before timeout. Internal Ports - This field accepts a comma-separated list of ports that will be internally exposed on the spun-up container. External Ports - This field accepts a comma-separated list of ports that will be externally exposed on the host machine. Privileged Mode - This flag if enabled will give the container root capabilities to all devices on the host system. Please be aware that setting this flag can be dangerous, and must only be used in exceptional situations. Environment Variables (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of environment variables, which will be set inside the container when spun up. Entrypoint Override (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list which is used to override the command used to start a container. Example: ./test.sh,-v,-d,--human-readable . Memory (optional) - This field allows the configuration of the maximum amount of memory the container can use in bytes. The value is a positive integer, optionally followed by a suffix of b, k, m, g, to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes. The minimum and default values depends by the native container orchestrator. If left empty, the memory assigned to the container will be set to a default value. CPUs (optional) - This value specifies how many CPUs a container can use. Decimal values are allowed, so if set to 1.5, the container will use at most one and a half cpu resource. GPUs (optional) - This field configures how many Nvidia GPUs a container can use. Allowed values are 'all' or an integer number. If there's no Nvidia GPU installed, leave it empty. The Nvidia Container Toolkit must be installed on the system to correctly configure the service, otherwise the container will not start. Volume Mount (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of system-to-container file mounts. This allows for the container to access files on the host machine. Peripheral Device (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of device paths. This parameter allows devices to be passed through from the host to the container. Networking Mode (optional) - Use this field to specify what networking mode the container will use. Possible Drivers include: bridge, none, container:{container id}, host. Please note that this field is case-sensitive. This field can also be used to connect to any of the networks listed by the cli command docker network ls . Logger Type - This field provides a drop-down selection of supported container logging drivers. Logger Parameters (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of logging parameters. More information can be found in the container-engine logger documentation, for instance here . After specifying container parameters, ensure to set Enabled to true and press Apply . The container engine will then pull the respective image, spin up and start the container. If the gateway or the framework is power cycled, and the container and Container Orchestration Service are set to enabled , the framework will automatically start the container again upon startup. Stopping the container Warning Stopping a container will delete it in an irreversible way. Please be sure to only use stateless containers and/or save their data in external volumes. To stop the container without deleting the component, set the Enabled field to false , and then press Apply . This will delete the running container, but leave this component available for running the container again in the future. If you want to completely remove the container and component, press the Delete button to the top right of the screen, and press Yes on the confirmation dialogue. Container Management Dashboard The Container Orchestration service also provides the user with an intuitive container dashboard. This dashboard shows all containers running on a gateway, including containers created with the framework and those created manually through the command-line interface.

The main features of this SQL Database are: Very fast, open source, JDBC API Embedded and server modes; in-memory databases Browser-based Console application Small footprint Supported Features Kura supports the following H2 database features: Persistence modes : The H2 implementation currently supports in-memory and file-based database instances. See the Persistence Modes section for more details. Multiple database instances : It is possible to create and configure multiple database instances from the Kura Administration UI, these instances can be selectively consumed by applications. A default database instance is created automatically. TCP Server : The current implementation allows external processes to access the database instances managed by Kura using TCP. This enables the integration of external applications that can share data with Kura components using the database. Web-based console : It is possible to start the H2 Web console directly from the Kura Administration UI. The console can be used to inspect the database contents and perform arbitrary queries for debug purposes. Basic credential management : The current implementation allows to change the password of the admin DB user from the Kura Administration UI. This allows the access restriction to the existing database instances. By default, the DataService in Kura uses the H2 database to persist the messages. Limitations Private in-memory instances : Only named in-memory instances are supported (e.g. jdbc:h2:mem:<dbname> , where <dbname> is not the empty string), private instances represented by the jdbc:h2:mem: URL are currently not supported. Remote connections : The current implementation only supports embedded database instances. Connecting to remote instances using the jdbc:h2:tcp:* and jdbc:h2:ssl:* connector URLs is not supported. Note The new DbWireRecordFilter and DbWireRecordStore Wire components have been added. These components provide the same functionalities offered by the old H2DbWireRecordFilter and H2DbWireRecordStore components, but they can be used for connectiong to a generic relational database (i.e. H2DB, MySQL or MariaDB). The legacy components will continue to be available in order to keep backward compatibility, but will be deprecated since Kura 5.2.0 and should not be used for new installations. Usage Creating a new H2 database instance To create a new H2 database instance, use the following procedure: Open the Administrative UI and press the + button in the side menu, under the Services section. A pop-up dialog should appear. Select org.eclipse.kura.core.db.H2DbService from the Factory drop-down list, enter an arbitrary name for the new instance and click Apply . An entry for the newly created instance should appear in the side menu under Services , click on it to review its configuration. It is not possible to create different DB instances that manage the same DB URL. When creating a new instance please make sure that the URL specified in the field db.connector.url is not managed by another instance. Selecting a database instance for existing components A database instance is identified by its Kura service PID . The PID for the default instance is org.eclipse.kura.db.H2DbService while the PID for instances created using the Web UI is the string entered in the Name field at step 2 of the previous section. The built-in components that use database functionalities allow to specify which instance to use in their configuration. These components are the DataService component of the cloud stack, the DbWireRecordFilter and DbWireRecordStore wire components. The configuration of each component contains a property that allows to specify the service PID of the desired instance. Enabling the TCP Server Danger This feature is intended to be used only for debugging/development purposes . The server created by H2 is not running on a secure protocol . Only enable the server for a limited time and make sure to properly secure the firewall ports on which it is running. The TCP server can be used by creating a H2DbServer instance: Open the Web UI and press the + button in the side menu, under the Services section. A pop-up dialog should appear. Select org.eclipse.kura.core.db.H2DbServer from the Factory drop-down\u200b list, enter an arbitrary name for the new instance and click Apply. Clicking on the name of the new server instance on the left side of the Web UI\u200b. The configuration of the server component will appear. Set the db.server.type field to TCP . Review the server options under db.server.commandline , check the official documentation for more information about the available options. Set the db.server.enabled to true . The server, with the default configuration, will be listening on port 9123. Tip Make sure to review the firewall configuration in order to ensure that the server is reachable from an external process. Enabling the Web Console Danger This feature is intended to be used only for debugging/development purposes . The server created by H2 is not running on a secure protocol . Only enable the server for a limited time and make sure to properly secure the firewall ports on which it is running. In order to enable the H2 Web console, proceed as follows: 1. Create a new H2DbServer instance. 2. Set the db.server.type field to WEB . 3. Enter appropriate parameters for the Web server in the db.server.commandline field. An example of valid settings can be -webPort 9123 -webAllowOthers -ifExists -webExternalNames <device-ip> . 4. Set the db.server.enabled to true . The server is now listening on the specified port. Tip Make sure to review the firewall configuration in order to ensure that the server is reachable from an external process. Use a browser to access the console. Open the http:// : URL, where is the IP address of the gateway and is the port specified at step 3. Enter the DB URL as specified in the Kura configuration in the JDBC URL field and the credentials. Click on Connect , you should be able to access the console. Change the Database Password To change the database password the System Administrator needs to: Open the configuration of the desired database instance in the Web UI. Enter the new password in the db.password field. Click Apply . Warn If the H2DbServer instance fails to open a database, it will delete and recreate all database files. This behavior\u200b is aimed at preventing potential issues caused by incorrect credentials in the configuration snapshots. It is highly recommended to perform a backup of an existing database before trying to open it using a H2DbService instance and before changing the password. Persistence Modes The H2 database supports several persistence modes. In Memory An in-memory database instance can be created using the following URL structure: jdbc:h2:mem: , where is a non-empty string that represents the database name. This configuration is suggested for database instances that are frequently updated. Examples: jdbc:h2:mem:kuradb jdbc:h2:mem:mydb The default database instance is in-memory by default and uses the jdbc:h2:mem:kuradb URL. Persistent A persistent database instance can be created using the jdbc:h2:file: , where is a non-empty string that represents the database path. If no URL parameters are supplied the database will enable the transaction log by default. The transaction log is used to restore the database to a consistent state after a crash or power failure. This provides good protection against data losses but causes a lot of writes to the storage device, reducing both performance and the lifetime of flash-based storage devices. Examples: - jdbc:h2:file:/opt/db/mydb Make sure to use absolute paths in the DB URL since H2 does not support DB paths relative to the working directory.","title":"H2Db Service"},{"location":"core-services/h2db-service/#h2db-service","text":"Kura integrates a Java SQL database named H2 .

It supports all major frameworks like TensorFlow, TensorRT, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and even custom framework backend. With specific backends, it is also possible to run Python scripts, mainly for pre-and post-processing purposes, and exploit the DALI building block for optimized operations. For more detail about the Triton Server, please refer to the official website . Kura provides three components for exposing the Triton Server service functionality which implement the inference engine APIs and provides methods for interacting with a local or remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server: TritonServerRemoteService : provides methods for interacting with a remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server without managing the server lifecycle. Can be used both for connecting to a remote instance or a local non-managed instance. It exposes a simpler but more limited configuration. TritonServerNativeService : provides methods for interacting with a local native Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. Requires the Triton Server executable to be already available on the device and offers more options and features (like AI Model Encryption). TritonServerContainerService : provides methods for interacting with a local container running Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. Requires the Triton Server container image to be already available on the device and offers more options and features (like AI Model Encryption). TritonServerService : provides methods for interacting with a local or remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server within the same component. Note : deprecated since 5.2.0 Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server installation Before running Kura's Triton Server Service, you must install the Triton Inference Server. Here you can find the necessary steps for the available suggested installation methods. Native Triton installation on Jetson devices A release of Triton for JetPack is provided in the tar file in the Triton Inference Server release notes . Full documentation is available here . Installation steps: Before running the executable you need to install the Runtime Dependencies for Triton . After doing so you can extract the tar file and run the executable in the bin folder. It is highly recommended to add the tritonserver executable to your path or symlinking the executable to /usr/local/bin . Triton Docker image installation Before you can use the Triton Docker image you must install Docker . If you plan on using a GPU for inference you must also install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit . Pull the image using the following command. $ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3 Where <xx.yy> is the version of Triton that you want to pull. Native Triton installation on supported devices The official docs mention the possibility to perform a native installation on supported platform by extracting the binaries from the Docker images. To do so you must install the necessary dependencies (some can be found in the Jetson runtime dependencies docs ) on the system. For Triton to support NVIDIA GPUs you must install CUDA, cuBLAS and cuDNN referencing the support matrix . Note For Python models the libraries available to the Python model are the ones available for the user running the Triton server. Therefore you'll need to install the libraries through pip for the kurad user. Triton Server setup The Triton Inference Server serves models from one or more model repositories that are specified when the server is started. The model repository is the directory where you place the models that you want Triton to serve. Be sure to follow the instructions to setup the model repository directory. Further information about an example Triton Server setup can be found in the official documentation . Triton Server Remote Service component The Kura Triton Server Remote Service component is the implementation of the inference engine APIs and provides methods for interacting with a remote (i.e. unmnanaged) Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. As presented below, the component enables the user to communicate to an external server to load specific models. With this component the server lifecycle (startup, shutdown) won't be handled by Kura and it's the user responsibility to make it available to Kura for connecting. The parameters used to configure the Triton Service are the following: Nvidia Triton Server address : the address of the Nvidia Triton Server. Nvidia Triton Server ports : the ports used to connect to the server for HTTP, GRPC, and Metrics services. Inference Models : a comma-separated list of inference model names that the server will load. The models have to be already present in the filesystem where the server is running. This option simply tells the server to load the given models from a local or remote repository. Timeout (in seconds) for time consuming tasks : Timeout (in seconds) for time consuming tasks like server startup, shutdown or model load.

Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] The Kura Triton Server component is the implementation of the inference engine APIs and provides methods for interacting with a local or remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. As presented below, the component enables the user to configure a local server running on the gateway or to communicate to an external server to load specific models. The parameters used to configure the Triton Service are the following: Local Nvidia Triton Server : If enabled, a local native Nvidia Triton Server is started on the gateway. In this case, the model repository and backends path are mandatory. Moreover, the server address property is overridden and set to localhost. Be aware that the Triton Server has to be already installed on the system. Nvidia Triton Server address : the address of the Nvidia Triton Server. Nvidia Triton Server ports : the ports used to connect to the server for HTTP, GRPC, and Metrics services. Local model repository path : Only for a local instance, specify the path on the filesystem where the models are stored. Local model decryption password : Only for local instance, specify the password to be used for decrypting models stored in the model repository. If none is specified, models are supposed to be plaintext. Inference Models : a comma-separated list of inference model names that the server will load.

The default ports are the 8000-8002, but these are tipically used by Kura for debug purposes. Configuration for a local native Triton Server with Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] Note Requirement : tritonserver executable needs to be available in the path to the kurad user. Be sure to have a working Triton Server installation before configuring the local native Triton Server instance through Kura UI. When the Local Nvidia Triton Server option is set to true, a local instance of the Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is started on the gateway. The following configuration is required: Local Nvidia Triton Server : true Nvidia Triton Server address : localhost Nvidia Triton Server ports : mandatory Local model repository path : mandatory Inference Models : mandatory. Note that the models have to be already present on the filesystem. Local backends path : mandatory The typical command used to start the Triton Server is like this: tritonserver --model-repository = <model_repository_path> \\ --backend-directory = <backend_repository_path> \\ --backend-config = <backend_config> \\ --http-port = <http_port> \\ --grpc-port = <grpc_port> \\ --metrics-port = <metrics_port> \\ --model-control-mode = explicit \\ --load-model = <model_name_1> \\ --load-model = <model_name_2> \\ ... Configuration for a local Triton Server running in a Docker container with Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] If the Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is running as a Docker container in the gateway, the following configuration is required: Local Nvidia Triton Server : false Nvidia Triton Server address : localhost Nvidia Triton Server ports : \\<mandatory> Inference Models : \\<mandatory>. The models have to be already present on the filesystem. In order to correctly load the models at runtime, configure the server with the --model-control-mode=explicit option. The typical command used for running the docker container is as follows. Note the forward of the ports to not interfere with Kura. docker run --rm \\ -p4000:8000 \\ -p4001:8001 \\ -p4002:8002 \\ --shm-size = 150m \\ -v path/to/models:/models \\ nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver: [ version ] \\ tritonserver --model-repository = /models --model-control-mode = explicit Configuration for a remote Triton Server with Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] When the Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is running on a remote server, the following configuration is needed: Local Nvidia Triton Server : false Nvidia Triton Server address : mandatory Nvidia Triton Server ports : mandatory Inference Models : mandatory. The models have to be already present on the filesystem. AI Model Encryption Support For ensuring inference integrity and providing copyright protection of deep-learning models on edge devices, Kura provides decryption capabilities for trained models to be served through the Triton Server. How it works Prerequisites : a deep-learning trained model (or more) exists with the corresponding necessary configuration for running on the Triton Server without encryption. A folder containing the required files (model, configuration etc) has been tested on a Triton Server. Restrictions : if model encryption is used, the following restrictions apply: model encryption support is only available for a local Triton Server instance all models in the folder containing the encrypted models must be encrypted all models must be encrypted with OpenPGP-compliant AES 256 cipher algorithm all models must be encrypted with the same password Once the development of the deep-learning model is complete, the developer who wants to deploy the model on the edge device in a secure manner can proceed with encrypting the Triton model using the procedure detailed below. After encrypting the model he/she can transfer the file on the edge device using his/her preferred method. Kura will keep the stored model protected at all times and have the model decrypted in runtime only for use by the Inference Server Runtime. As soon as the model is correctly loaded into memory the decrypted model will be removed from the filesystem. As an additional security measure, the Model Repository containing the decrypted models will be stored in a temporary subfolder and will feature restrictive permission such that only Kura, the Inference Server and the root user will be able to access it. Encryption procedure Given a trained model inside the folder tf_autoencoder_fp32 (for example) with the following layout (see the official documentation for details): tf_autoencoder_fp32 \u251c\u2500\u2500 1 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 model.savedmodel \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 keras_metadata.pb \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 saved_model.pb \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 variables \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 variables.data-00000-of-00001 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 variables.index \u2514\u2500\u2500 config.pbtxt Compress the model into a zip archive with the following command: zip -vr tf_autoencoder_fp32.zip tf_autoencoder_fp32/ then encrypt it with the AES 256 algorithm using the following gpg command: gpg --armor --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 tf_autoencoder_fp32.zip The resulting archive tf_autoencoder_fp32.zip.asc can be transferred to the Local Model Repository Path on the target machine and will be decrypted by Kura.","title":"Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server Inference Engine"},{"location":"core-services/nvidia-triton-server-inference-engine/#nvidiatm-triton-server-inference-engine","text":"The Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is an open-source inference service software that enables the user to deploy trained AI models from any framework on GPU or CPU infrastructure.

This 'fake' interface name is replaced by 'proper' interface name (e.g., ppp0) when the first modem configuration is submitted. The cellular interface should be configured by first enabling it in the TCP/IP tab, and then setting the Cellular tab. Note that the cellular interface can only be set as WAN using DHCP . The cellular interface configuration options are described below. Cellular Configuration The Cellular tab contains the following configuration parameters: Model : specifies the modem model. Network Technology : describes the network technology used by this modem. HSDPA EVDO Modem Identifier : provides a unique name for this modem. Interface # : provides a unique number for the modem interface (e.g., an interface # of 0 would name the modem interface ppp0). Dial String : instructs how the modem should attempt to connect. Typical dial strings are as follows: HSPA modem: atd*99***1# EVDO/CDMA modem: atd#777 APN : defines the modem access point name (HSPA modems only). Auth Type : specifies the authentication type (HSPA modems only). None Auto CHAP PAP Username : supplies the username; disabled if no authentication method is specified. Password : supplies the password; disabled if no authentication method is specified. Modem Reset Timeout : sets the modem reset timeout in minutes. If set to a non-zero value, the modem is reset after n consecutive minutes of unsuccessful connection attempts. If set to zero, the modem keeps trying to establish a PPP connection without resetting. The default value is 5 minutes. Reopen Connection on Termination : sets the persist option of the PPP daemon that specifies if PPP daemon should exit after connection is terminated. Note that the maxfail option still has an effect on persistent connections. Connection Attempts : sets the maxfail option of the PPP daemon that limits the number of consecutive failed PPP connection attempts. The default value is 5 connection attempts. A value of zero means no limit. The PPP daemon terminates after the specified number of failed PPP connection attempts and restarts by the ModemMonitor thread. Disconnect if Idle : sets the idle option of the PPP daemon, which terminates the PPP connection if the link is idle for a specified number of seconds. The default value is 95 seconds. To disable this option, set it to zero. Active Filter : sets the active-filter option of the PPP daemon. This option specifies a packet filter (filter-expression) to be applied to data packets in order to determine which packets are regarded as link activity, and thereby, reset the idle timer. The filter-expression syntax is as described for tcpdump(1); however, qualifiers that do not apply to a PPP link, such as ether and arp , are not permitted. The default value is inbound . To disable the active-filter option, leave it blank. LCP Echo Interval : sets the lcp-echo-interval option of the PPP daemon. If set to a positive number, the modem sends LCP echo request to the peer at the specified number of seconds. To disable this option, set it to zero. This option may be used with the lcp-echo-failure option to detect that the peer is no longer connected. LCP Echo Failure : sets the lcp-echo-failure option of the PPP daemon. If set to a positive number, the modem presumes the peer to be dead if a specified number of LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply. To disable this option, set it to zero. Enable GPS : enables GPS with the following conditions: One modem port will be dedicated to NMEA data stream. This port may not be used to send AT commands to the modem. PositionService should be enabled. Serial settings of PositionService should not be changed; it will be redirected to the modem GPS port automatically. Cellular Linux Configuration This section describes the changes applied by Kura at the Linux networking configuration. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state.

The DataService delegates to the MqttDataTransport service the implementation of the transport protocol that is used to interact with the remote server. The DataService also adds the capability of storing published messages in a persistent store function and sending them over the wire at a later time. The purpose of this feature is to relieve service users from implementing their own persistent store. Service users may publish messages independently on the DataService connection status. In order to overcome the potential latencies introduced by buffering messages, the DataService allows a priority level to be assigned to\u200b each published message. Depending on the store configuration, there are certain guarantees that stored messages are not lost due to sudden crashes or power outages. To use this service, select the DataService option located in the Cloud Connections area as shown in the screen capture below. The DataService offers methods and configuration options to manage the connection to the remote server including the following (all required) parameters described below. connect.auto-on-startup : when set to true, the service tries to auto-connect to the remote server on start-up and restore the connection every time the device is disconnected. These attempts are made at the frequency defined in the connect.retry-interval parameter until the connection is established. connect.retry-interval : specifies the connection retry frequency after a disconnection. enable.recovery.on.connection.failure : when enabled, activates the recovery feature on connection failure: if the device is not able to connect to a remote cloud platform, the service will wait for a specified amount of connection retries. If the recovery fails, the device will be rebooted. Being based on the Watchdog service, it needs to be activated as well. connection.recovery.max.failures : related to the previous parameter.

Additionally, Kura provides the ability to manage network access security to an IoT Gateway through the following: Open Ports (local service rules) Port Forwarding IP Forwarding and Masquerading (NAT service rules) 'Automatic' NAT service rules Open Ports, Port Forwarding, and IP Forwarding and Masquerading are configured via respective Firewall configuration tabs. 'Automatic' NAT is enabled for each local (LAN) interface using the DHCP & NAT tab of the respective interface configuration. Firewall Linux Configuration This section describes the changes applied by Kura at the Linux networking configuration. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state. When a new firewall configuration is submitted, Kura immediately applies it using the iptables service provided by the OS. Moreover, the rules are stored in the filesystem and a new Kura snapshot is generated containing the new configuration. At the next startup, the firewall service in the OS will re-apply them and Kura will check the firewall configuration against the one contained in the last snapshot. In this way, the user can update the snapshot with the needed rules and apply them to the system using the webUI or modify the snapshot_0.xml before the first start of Kura. In order to allow a better coexistence between Kura and external applications that need to modify firewall rules, Kura writes its rules to a set of custom iptables chains. They are input-kura , output-kura , forward-kura , forward-kura-pf and forward-kura-ipf for the filter table and input-kura , output-kura , prerouting-kura , prerouting-kura-pf , postrouting-kura , postrouting-kura-pf and postrouting-kura-ipf for the nat table. The custom chains are then put in their respective standard iptables chains, as shown in the following: iptables -t filter -I INPUT -j input-kura iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -j output-kura iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -j forward-kura iptables -t filter -I forward-kura -j forward-kura-pf iptables -t filter -I forward-kura -j forward-kura-ipf iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -j prerouting-kura iptables -t nat -I prerouting-kura -j prerouting-kura-pf iptables -t nat -I INPUT -j input-kura iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -j output-kura iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -j postrouting-kura iptables -t nat -I postrouting-kura -j postrouting-kura-pf iptables -t nat -I postrouting-kura -j postrouting-kura-ipf Even if many firewall rules can be handled by Kura, it could be that some rules cannot be filled through the Web Console. In this case, custom firewall rules may be added to the /etc/init.d/firewall_cust script manually. These rules are applied/reapplied every time the firewall service starts, that is at the gateway startup. These custom rules should not be applied to the Kura custom chains, but to the standard ones. Open Ports If Kura is running on a gateway, all TCP/UDP ports are closed by default unless they are listed in the Open Ports tab of the Firewall section in the Gateway Administration Console, or in the /etc/sysconfig/iptables script. Therefore, if a user needs to connect to a specific port on a gateway, it is insufficient to have an application listening on the desired port; the port also needs to be opened in the firewall. To open a port using the Gateway Administration Console, select the Firewall option located in the System area. The Firewall configuration display appears in the main window. With the Open Ports tab selected, click the New button. The New Open Port Entry form appears. The New Open Port Entry form contains the following configuration parameters: Port : specifies the port to be opened. (Required field.) Protocol : defines the protocol (tcp or udp). (Required field.) Permitted Network : only allows packets originated by a host on this network. Permitted Interface Name : only allows packets arrived on this interface. Unpermitted Interface Name : blocks packets arrived on this interface. Permitted MAC Address : only allows packets originated by this host. Source Port Range : only allows packets with source port in the defined range. Complete the New Open Port Entry form and click the Submit button when finished. Once the form is submitted, a new port entry will appear. Click the Apply button for the change to take effect. The firewall rules related to the open ports section are stored in the input-kura custom chain of the filter table. Port Forwarding Port forwarding rules are needed to establish connectivity from the WAN side to a specific port on a host that resides on a LAN behind the gateway. In this case, a routing solution may be avoided since the connection is made to a specified external port on a gateway, and packets are forwarded to an internal port on the destination host; therefore, it is not necessary to add the external port to the list of open ports. To add a port forwarding rule, select the Port Forwarding tab on the Firewall display and click the New button. The Port Forward Entry form appears. The Port Forward Entry form contains the following configuration parameters: Input Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be received. (Required field). Output Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be forwarded to its destination. (Required field). LAN Address : supplies the IP address of destination host. (Required field). Protocol : defines the protocol (tcp or udp). (Required field). External Port : provides the external destination port on gateway unit. (Required field). Internal Port : provides the port on a destination host. (Required field). Enable Masquerading : defines whether masquerading is used (yes or no). If enabled, the gateway replaces the IP address of the originating host with the IP address of its own output (LAN) interface. This is needed when the destination host does not have a back route to the originating host (or default gateway route) via the gateway unit. The masquerading option is provided with port forwarding to limit gateway forwarding only to the destination port. (Required field). Permitted Network : only forwards if the packet is originated from a host on this network. Permitted MAC Address : only forwards if the packet is originated by this host. Source Port Range : only forwards if the packet's source port is within the defined range. Complete the Port Forward Entry form and click the Apply button for the desired port forwarding rules to take effect. The firewall rules related to the port forwarding section are stored in the forward-kura-pf custom chain of the filter table and in the postrouting-kura-pf and prerouting-kura-pf chains of the nat table. Port Forwarding example This section describes an example of port forwarding rules. The initial setup is described below. A couple of RaspberryPi that shares the same LAN over Ethernet. The first RaspberryPi running Kura is configured as follows: The eth0 interface static with IP address of 172.16.0.5. There is no default gateway. The second RaspberryPi running Kura is configured as follows: The eth0 interface LAN/static with IP address of 172.16.0.1/24 and no NAT. The wlan0 interface is WAN/DHCP client. A laptop is connected to the same network of the wlan0 of the second RaspberryPi and can ping its wlan0 interface. The purpose of the second RaspberryPi configuration is to enable access to the Administration Console running on the first one (port 80) by connecting to the second RaspberryPi's port 8080 over the wlan. This scenario assumes that IP addresses are assigned as follows: Second RaspberryPi wlan0 - 10.200.12.6 Laptop wlan0 - 10.200.12.10 The following port forwarding entries are added to the second RaspberryPi configuration as described above using the Port Forward Entry form: Input Interface - wlan0 Output Interface - eth0 LAN Address - 172.16.0.5 Protocol - tcp External Port - 8080 Internal Port - 80 Masquerade - yes The Permitted Network , Permitted MAC Address , and Source Port Range fields are left blank. The following iptables rules are applied and added to the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file: iptables -t nat -A prerouting-kura-pf -i wlan0 -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to 172 .16.0.5:80 iptables -t nat -A postrouting-kura-pf -o eth0 -p tcp -d 172 .16.0.5 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A forward-kura-pf -i wlan0 -o eth0 -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 --dport 80 -d 172 .16.0.5 -j ACCEPT iptables -A forward-kura-pf -i eth0 -o wlan0 -p tcp -s 172 .16.0.5 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT The following iptables commands may be used to verify that the new rules have been applied: sudo iptables -v -n -L sudo iptables -v -n -L -t nat At this point, it is possible to try to connect to http://10.200.12.6 and to http://10.200.12.6:8080 from the laptop. Note that when a connection is made to the device on port 80, it is to the Kura configuration page on the device itself (the second RaspberryPi). When the gateway is connected on port 8080, you are forwarded to the Kura Gateway Administration Console on the first RaspberryPi. The destination host can only be reached by connecting to the gateway on port 8080. Another way to connect to the Kura Gateway Administration Console on the first RaspberryPi would be to add an IP Forwarding/Masquerading entry as described in the next section. IP Forwarding/Masquerading The advantage of the Automatic NAT method is its simplicity. However, this approach does not handle reverse NATing, and it cannot be used for interfaces that are not listed in the Gateway Administration Console (such as VPN tun0 interface). To set up generic (one-to-many) NATing, select the IP Forwarding/Masquerading tab on the Firewall display. The IP Forwarding/Masquerading form appears. The IP Forwarding/Masquerading form contains the following configuration parameters: Input Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be received. (Required field). Output Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be forwarded to its destination. (Required field). Protocol : defines the protocol of the rule to check (all, tcp, or udp). (Required field). Source Network/Host : identifies the source network or host name (CIDR notation). Set to 0.0.0.0/0 if empty. Destination Network/Host : identifies the destination network or host name (CIDR notation). Set to 0.0.0.0/0 if empty. Enable Masquerading : defines whether masquerading is used (yes or no). If set to 'yes', masquerading is enabled. If set to 'no', only FORWARDING rules are be added. (Required field). The rules will be added to the forward-kura-ipf chain in the filter table and in the postrouting-kura-ipf one in the nat table. As a use-case scenario, consider the same setup as in port forwarding, but with cellular interface disabled and eth1 interface configured as WAN/DHCP client. In this case, the interfaces of the gateway are configured as follows: eth0 : LAN/Static/No NAT 172.16.0.1/24 eth1 : WAN/DHCP 10.11.5.4/24 To reach the gateway sitting on the 172.16.0.5/24 from a specific host on the 10.11.0.0/16 network, set up the following Reverse NAT entry: Input Interface: eth1 (WAN interface) Output Interface: eth0 (LAN interface) Protocol: all Source Network/Host: 10.11.5.21/32 Destination Network/Host: 172.16.0.5/32 Enable Masquerading: yes This case applies the following iptables rules: iptables -t nat -A postrouting-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 10 .11.5.21/32 -d 172 .16.0.5/32 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 172 .16.0.5/32 -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 10 .11.5.21/32 -d 172 .16.0.5/32 -i eth1 -o eth0 -m tcp -j ACCEPT Additionally, a route to the 172.16.0.0/24 network needs to be configured on a connecting laptop as shown below: sudo route add -net 172 .16.0.0 netmask 255 .255.255.0 gw 10 .11.5.4 Since masquerading is enabled, there is no need to specify the back route on the destination host. Note that with this setup, the gateway only forwards packets originating on the 10.11.5.21 laptop to the 172.16.0.5 destination. If the Source Network/Host and Destination Network/Host fields are empty, iptables rules appear as follows: iptables -t nat -A postrouting-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 -d 0 .0.0.0/0 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 -d 0 .0.0.0/0 -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT The gateway forwards packets from any external host (connected to eth1) to any destination on the local network (eth0 interface).","title":"Firewall Configuration"},{"location":"gateway-configuration/firewall-configuration/#firewall-configuration","text":"Kura offers easy management of the Linux firewall iptables included in an IoT Gateway.

Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state. When a new firewall configuration is submitted, Kura immediately applies it using the iptables service provided by the OS. Moreover, the rules are stored in the filesystem and a new Kura snapshot is generated containing the new configuration. At the next startup, the firewall service in the OS will re-apply them and Kura will check the firewall configuration against the one contained in the last snapshot. In this way, the user can update the snapshot with the needed rules and apply them to the system using the webUI or modify the snapshot_0.xml before the first start of Kura. In order to allow a better coexistence between Kura and external applications that need to modify firewall rules, Kura writes its rules to a set of custom iptables chains. They are input-kura , output-kura , forward-kura , forward-kura-pf and forward-kura-ipf for the filter table and input-kura , output-kura , prerouting-kura , prerouting-kura-pf , postrouting-kura , postrouting-kura-pf and postrouting-kura-ipf for the nat table.

In this case, custom firewall rules may be added to the /etc/init.d/firewall_cust script manually.

The Kura Gateway Administration Console enables you to monitor the gateway status, manage the network configuration, and manage the installed application and services. Access to the Kura Gateway Administration Console requires that a unit running Eclipse Kura is reachable via its Ethernet primary interface. Connections on HTTP port 443 for these interfaces are allowed by default through the built-in firewall. The Kura Gateway Administration Console can be accessed by typing the IP address of the gateway into the browser's URL bar. Once the URL is submitted, the user is required to log in and is then redirected to the Administration Console (e.g., https://192.168.2.8/admin/console ) shown in the screen capture below. The default login name and password is admin/admin . Warning It is recommended to change the default password after initial setup and before deployment, as well as limiting access to the Administration Console to a trusted local network interface using appropriate firewall rules. Password change Once logged in, the user can modify its password (recommended after the first login). To access the option, click on the button near the username in the header section. A dropdown menu appears with the logout and the password modification options. When clicking on \"Change password\", the following dialog will appear: After confirming the changes, the user will be logged out. Accessing the ESF Gateway Administration Console over a Cellular Link In order to connect to the Gateway Administration Console via a cellular interface, the following requirements must be met: The service plan must allow for a static, public IP address to be assigned to the cellular interface. The used ports must not be blocked by the provider. The user must add Open Port entries for the cellular interface. This may be done either through the Firewall tab. If some of the used ports are blocked by the service provider, there is an option to reconfigure the gateway to use another port (i.e., 8080). In order to do so, the following requirements must be met: The HttpService configuration must be changed to use the new ports. The new ports must be open in the firewall for all network interfaces. HTTPS related warnings Most browsers will probably warn the user that the connection is not secure when Gateway Administration Console is accessed using HTTPS. In order to remove the warning, the browser must be able to verify the identity of the gateway as an HTTPS server.

Tip It is recommended that the TCP/IP tab is configured first since it defines how the interface is going to be used. TCP/IP Configuration The TCP/IP tab contains the following configuration parameters: Status Disabled: disables the selected interface (i.e., administratively down). Enabled for LAN: designates the interface for a local network. It can be set as a DHCP server for hosts on the local network and can serve as a default gateway for those hosts; however, it cannot be set as an actual gateway interface for this device. That is, packets must be routed from this interface to another interface that is configured as WAN. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Enabled for WAN: designates the interface as a gateway to an external network. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Not Managed: the interface will be ignored by Kura. Layer 2 Only: only the Layer 2 portion of the interface will be configured. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Configure Manually: allows manual entry of the IP Address and Netmask fields, if the interface is configured as LAN; allows manual entry of the IP Address , Netmask , Gateway , and DNS Servers fields, if the interface is designated as WAN. Using DHCP: configures the interface as a DHCP client obtaining the IP address from a network DHCP server. IP Address - defines the IP address of the interface, if manually configured. Subnet Mask - defines the subnet mask of the interface, if manually configured. Gateway - specifies the default gateway for the unit. (Required field if the interface is designated as WAN and manually configured.) DNS Servers - provides a list of DNS servers, if the interface is designated as WAN and is manually configured. Search Domains - Not implemented. If the network interface is Enabled for LAN and manually configured (i.e., not a DHCP client), the DHCP & NAT tab allows the DHCP server to be configured and/or NAT (IP forwarding with masquerading) to be enabled. DHCP & NAT Configuration The DHCP & NAT tab contains the following configuration parameters: Router Mode DHCP and NAT: indicates that both DHCP server and NAT are enabled. DHCP Only: indicates that DHCP server is enabled and NAT is disabled. NAT Only: indicates that NAT is enabled and DHCP server is disabled. Off: indicates that both DHCP server and NAT are disabled. DHCP Beginning Address : specifies the first address of DHCP pool (i.e., first available client IP address). DHCP Ending Address : specifies the last address of DHCP pool (i.e., last IP address that can be assigned to a client). DHCP Subnet Mask : defines the subnet mask that is assigned to a client. DHCP Default Lease Time : sets the default time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. DHCP Max Lease Time : sets the maximum time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. Pass DNS Servers through DHCP : enables DNS Proxy (i.e., passing DNS servers through DHCP). If NAT is enabled and there is another interface designated as WAN (e.g., ppp0), the following iptables rules are added to the custom automatic NAT service rules _* section of the /etc/init.d/firewall script: # custom automatic NAT service rules (if NAT option is enabled for LAN interface) iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o ppp0 -j ACCEPT Also, IP forwarding is enabled in the kernel as follows: # allow fowarding if any masquerade is defined echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward The rules shown above create an Overloaded _ (i.e., many-to-one) NAT. This type of network address translation maps multiple IP addresses on the LAN side to a single IP address on the WAN side, allowing internet access from hosts on a local network via a gateway (WAN) interface. Note that for NAT rules to be added, it is insufficient to enable NATing through the DHCP & NAT * tab of the LAN interface; there must also be another interface designated as WAN. Network Linux Configuration When applying a new network configuration, Kura changes the configuration files of the Linux networking subsystem. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state.

The snippets can be modified adapting them to the required configuration (i.e. changing the interface name in the property to be applied). Warning Be aware that an inconsitent or wrong configuration can compromise the network functionality of the gateway. Try the new configuration on a test device before appling it in a production environment! Moreover, if a property is not present in the new snapshot, the old value is used for the configuration. So, the best practice is to set all the needed properties in the snapshot.

With this option selected, the Network display appears with a list of available interfaces. Configuration tabs for the selected interface appear on the right side of the screen. By default, the loopback (lo) interface is selected when the network interfaces are displayed. Choose the desired network interface (e.g., eth0, eth1, wlan0, ppp0) and apply the necessary configuration changes using the tabs on the right. Submit the modified configuration by clicking the Apply button. In case of typing errors, the Reset button can be used to reload the prior configuration on the screen. Since the network configuration shown on the screen may not be synchronized with the current state of the system, it can be updated pressing the Refresh button. This can be used also to force the reload of specific parameters like the RSSI or dynamic IP addresses. The refresh procedure reads all the needed parameters from the system and can take several seconds before updating.

That is, packets must be routed from this interface to another interface that is configured as WAN. The interface is automatically brought up at boot.

Layer 2 Only: only the Layer 2 portion of the interface will be configured. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Configure Manually: allows manual entry of the IP Address and Netmask fields, if the interface is configured as LAN; allows manual entry of the IP Address , Netmask , Gateway , and DNS Servers fields, if the interface is designated as WAN. Using DHCP: configures the interface as a DHCP client obtaining the IP address from a network DHCP server. IP Address - defines the IP address of the interface, if manually configured. Subnet Mask - defines the subnet mask of the interface, if manually configured. Gateway - specifies the default gateway for the unit.

DHCP Beginning Address : specifies the first address of DHCP pool (i.e., first available client IP address). DHCP Ending Address : specifies the last address of DHCP pool (i.e., last IP address that can be assigned to a client). DHCP Subnet Mask : defines the subnet mask that is assigned to a client. DHCP Default Lease Time : sets the default time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. DHCP Max Lease Time : sets the maximum time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. Pass DNS Servers through DHCP : enables DNS Proxy (i.e., passing DNS servers through DHCP).

This type of network address translation maps multiple IP addresses on the LAN side to a single IP address on the WAN side, allowing internet access from hosts on a local network via a gateway (WAN) interface.

It uses the associated KeystoreService to access the trust certificates, private keys pairs needed to setup a SSL connection. It also enforces best practices that are not enabled by default in the Java VM, such as, enabling hostname verification, disabling the legacy SSL-2.0-compatible Client Hello, and disabling the Nagle algorithm. The list of all available SSL Service instances is available in the SSL Configuration tab of the Security section, accessible only by the users with the corresponding permission. By default, the framework creates a SSLManagerService instance with the org.eclipse.kura.ssl.SslManagerService PID. This instance is generally used by all the core services of the framework. A new SSL Service instance can be created using the New Button, by specifying the desired factory and the Service PID that will be associated with this new instance. An instance of the default org.eclipse.kura.ssl.SslManagerService factory has the following configuration parameters: KeystoreService Target Filter - specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the KeystoreService used to manage the SSL key store (Required field). Truststore Target Filter - specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the KeystoreService used to manage the SSL trust store. If the target service cannot be found, the service configured with the Keystore Target Filter parameter will be used as truststore. ssl.default.protocol - defines the allowed SSL protocol. ssl.hostname.verification - indicates whether hostname verification is enabled or disabled. ssl.default.cipherSuites - defines the allowed cipher suites. By selecting the Select available targets button, the user can associate the SSLManagerService instance with the corresponding KeystoreService instances available in the framework runtime. Server SSL Certificate The device requires a public key in its trust store in order to authenticate the broker and be able to setup an SSL connection. Kura is distributed with a pre-initialized SSL keystore that contains only some of the major Certification Authorities (CA) public keys. If the broker uses a certificate signed by a different CA, or uses an auto-signed certificate, the system administrator must setup Kura with the correct certificates used to trust the remote cloud broker. The inclusion of public certificates is accomplished with the Server SSL Certificate feature. To do so, the SSL Certificates form must be completed by providing a certificate or a certificates chain to be trusted and defining the alias used to register this new data in the device's trust store. With this feature, when the device tries to instantiate an SSL connection with the broker, it receives the broker's public key chain. The SSL connection is secured only if the received chain is trusted. This connection can only happen if one of the certificates that compose the broker chain are available in the device's trust store. When instantiating the device's trust store, the user decides whether to add a single certificate (leaf or CA certificate) or the full chain. In the latter case, the chain should be provided by specifying the leaf certificate, followed by the CA certificate that is signing it, and so on, until the root CA is reached. An example of this scenario is depicted in the following image: Device SSL Certificate & Mutual Authentication Mutual authentication is a technique that allows authentication of the device that is connecting to the broker. The form available in Certificates List may be used to specify the keys needed to enable mutual authentication. This authentication may be accomplished by specifying a couple of certificates (private and public keys) to be used by the client device to authenticate itself to the broker. This authentication is possible because the broker has the root CA certificate that has been used to sign the couple held by the device. In this way, the authenticity of the couple of certificates held by the device may be verified, and therefore, enable the two communicating parts (the broker and the device) to trust each other. To enable mutual authentication, the user must complete the form with a well-formed key pair (public and private), and with an alias value that corresponds with the account name used to connect to the broker. Key Pair Generation The keys may be generated using specific software, such as OpenSSL or Keytool . This section describes how to use OpenSSL to generate a couple of private and public keys. The private key may be created using the following command: openssl genrsa -out certsDirectory/certs/certificate.key 1024 This command creates a new, 1024-bit private key in the specified path. This key is used to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file, which is used by a CA to authenticate the certificate's creator. A CSR file is created with OpenSSL using the following command: openssl req -new -key certsDirectory/certs/certificate.key -out certsDirectory/crl/certificate.csr If the user is creating their own certificate chain, the CSR file may be signed using a personal CA. This process may be accomplished using OpenSSL with the following command: openssl ca -config certsDirectory/openssl.cnf -days 3650 -keyfile certsDirectory/ca/ca.key -cert certsDirectory/ca/ca.pem -out certsDirectory/certs/certificate.pem -infiles certsDirectory/crl/certificate.csr The parameters are defined as follows: -config : specifies the OpenSSL configuration file that must be used to sign the certificate. -days : specifies how long the certificate is valid. -keyfile and -cert : allow the specification of the CA that will sign the CSR file. -out : identifies the location and the name of the signed certificate that will be created. -infiles : identifies the location of the CSR file that has to be signed. Tip The private key may not be placed into the Kura Gateway Administration Console without a format conversion. OpenSSL offers the following command to convert the input private key to a non-encrypted PKCS#8 format that may be processed by the Kura code: openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in inPrivateKey.key -out outKey.pem -nocrypt","title":"SSL Configuration"},{"location":"gateway-configuration/ssl-configuration/#ssl-configuration","text":"A SSL Service instance manages the configuration of the SSL connections.

In addition to the TCP/IP and DHCP & NAT configuration tabs, it has the Wireless tab that allows for the configuration of wireless settings. These configuration options are described below. Warning Before using wifi make sure that you have correctly set the Regulatory Domain on the gateway. You can check the current configuration using the iw reg get command. To set the Regulatory Domain please refer to the specific section in the Gateway Configurations. Wireless Configuration The Wireless tab contains the following configuration parameters: Wireless Mode : defines the mode of operation. Access Point: creates a wireless access point. Station Mode: connects to a wireless access point. Network Name : specifies the Service Set Identifier (SSID). In Access Point mode, this is the SSID that identifies this wireless network. In Station mode, this is the SSID of a wireless network to connect to. Radio Mode : defines 802.11 mode. 802.11 ac/n/a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) 802.11n/g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) Wireless Security : sets the security protocol for the wireless network. None: No Wi-Fi security WEP: Wired Equivalent Privacy WPA: Wi-Fi Protected Access WPA2: Wi-Fi Protected Access II Wireless Password : sets the password for the wireless network. WEP: 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key WPA/WPA2: pre-shared key Verify Password : sets the password verification field. In Access Point mode, allows the wireless password to be retyped for verification. In Station mode, this field is disabled. Pairwise Ciphers : lists accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Group Ciphers : lists accepted group (broadcast/multicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Bgscan Module : requests background scans for the purpose of roaming within an ESS (i.e., within a single network block with all the APs using the same SSID). None: background scan is disabled Simple: periodic background scans based on signal strength Learn: learn channels used by the network and try to avoid bgscans on other channels Bgscan Signal Strength Threshold : defines a threshold (in dBm) that determines which one of the following two parameters (i.e., Short Interval or Long Interval ) will be effective. Bgscan Short Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is worse than signal_strength. Bgscan Long Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is better than signal_strength. Ping Access Point & renew DHCP lease if not reachable : enables pinging the access point after connection is established. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, if set to true , the unit will ping the access point and attempt to renew the DHCP lease if the access point is not reachable. Ignore Broadcast SSID : operates as follows if set to true : In Access Point mode, sends an empty SSID in beacons and ignores probe request frames that do not specify full SSID. In Station mode, does not scan for the SSID before attempting to associate. Channels table : allows the selection of desired channel frequencies. The availability of the desired frequency is subject to the Regdom set on the device. For a list of limitations in different countries you can consult the following page: List of WLAN channels . Channels marked as No Irradiation and Radar Detection can be used only if DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) is supported by the Wi-Fi chip. In Access Point mode, only one channel may be selected. In Station mode, the list of available channels depends on the selected Radio Mode. The selected radio mode also affects the ability to select a network in the scan window (if the channel associated with the network is not enabled in the regulatory domain an error message will be shown). Wi-Fi Station Mode Configuration In addition to the options described above, the Wireless configuration display provides two buttons that help to configure Wi-Fi in the Station mode. These buttons are described below. Access Point Scan : clicking this button triggers access point scan operations. Upon a successful scan, a table containing access points within range is presented. This table contains the following information: SSID MAC Address Signal Strength (in dBm) Channel Frequency Security If you select one of these access points, respective wireless controls (i.e., Network Name , Wireless Security , and Channel ) are filled with information obtained during the scan operation. Password Verification : clicking this button triggers password verification before a full connection is established. Wi-Fi Linux Configuration This section describes the changes applied by Kura at the Linux networking configuration. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state.

In Access Point mode, this is the SSID that identifies this wireless network. In Station mode, this is the SSID of a wireless network to connect to. Radio Mode : defines 802.11 mode. 802.11 ac/n/a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) 802.11n/g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) Wireless Security : sets the security protocol for the wireless network. None: No Wi-Fi security WEP: Wired Equivalent Privacy WPA: Wi-Fi Protected Access WPA2: Wi-Fi Protected Access II Wireless Password : sets the password for the wireless network. WEP: 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key WPA/WPA2: pre-shared key Verify Password : sets the password verification field. In Access Point mode, allows the wireless password to be retyped for verification. In Station mode, this field is disabled. Pairwise Ciphers : lists accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Group Ciphers : lists accepted group (broadcast/multicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Bgscan Module : requests background scans for the purpose of roaming within an ESS (i.e., within a single network block with all the APs using the same SSID). None: background scan is disabled Simple: periodic background scans based on signal strength Learn: learn channels used by the network and try to avoid bgscans on other channels Bgscan Signal Strength Threshold : defines a threshold (in dBm) that determines which one of the following two parameters (i.e., Short Interval or Long Interval ) will be effective. Bgscan Short Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is worse than signal_strength. Bgscan Long Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is better than signal_strength. Ping Access Point & renew DHCP lease if not reachable : enables pinging the access point after connection is established. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, if set to true , the unit will ping the access point and attempt to renew the DHCP lease if the access point is not reachable. Ignore Broadcast SSID : operates as follows if set to true : In Access Point mode, sends an empty SSID in beacons and ignores probe request frames that do not specify full SSID. In Station mode, does not scan for the SSID before attempting to associate. Channels table : allows the selection of desired channel frequencies. The availability of the desired frequency is subject to the Regdom set on the device. For a list of limitations in different countries you can consult the following page: List of WLAN channels . Channels marked as No Irradiation and Radar Detection can be used only if DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) is supported by the Wi-Fi chip. In Access Point mode, only one channel may be selected. In Station mode, the list of available channels depends on the selected Radio Mode. The selected radio mode also affects the ability to select a network in the scan window (if the channel associated with the network is not enabled in the regulatory domain an error message will be shown).","title":"Wireless Configuration"},{"location":"gateway-configuration/wifi-configuration/#wi-fi-station-mode-configuration","text":"In addition to the options described above, the Wireless configuration display provides two buttons that help to configure Wi-Fi in the Station mode.

This table contains the following information: SSID MAC Address Signal Strength (in dBm) Channel Frequency Security If you select one of these access points, respective wireless controls (i.e., Network Name , Wireless Security , and Channel ) are filled with information obtained during the scan operation.
