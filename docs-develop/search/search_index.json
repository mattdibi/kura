Advanced software frameworks, which abstract and isolate the developer from the complexity of the hardware and the networking sub-systems, re-define the development and re-usability of integrated hardware and software solutions. Eclipse Kura is an Eclipse IoT project that provides a platform for building IoT gateways. It is a smart application container that enables remote management of such gateways and provides a wide range of APIs for allowing you to write and deploy your own IoT application. Kura runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and leverages OSGi, a dynamic component system for Java, to simplify the process of writing reusable software building blocks. Kura APIs offer easy access to the underlying hardware including serial ports, GPS, watchdog, USB, GPIOs, I2C, etc. It also offer OSGI bundle to simplify the management of network configurations, the communication with IoT servers, and the remote management of the gateway. Kura components are designed as configurable OSGi Declarative Service exposing service API and raising events. While several Kura components are in pure Java, others are invoked through JNI and have a dependency on the Linux operating system. Kura comes with the following services: I/O Services Serial port access through javax.comm 2.0 API or OSGi I/O connection USB access and events through javax.usb, HID API, custom extensions Bluetooth access through javax.bluetooth or OSGi I/O connection Position Service for GPS information from an NMEA stream Clock Service for the synchronization of the system clock Kura API for GPIO/PWM/I2C/SPI access Data Services Store and forward functionality for the telemetry data collected by the gateway and published to remote servers. Policy-driven publishing system, which abstracts the application developer from the complexity of the network layer and the publishing protocol used. Eclipse Paho and its MQTT client provide the default messaging library used. Cloud Services Easy to use API layer for IoT application to communicate with a remote server. In addition to simple publish/subscribe, the Cloud Service API simplifies the implementation of more complex interaction flows like request/response or remote resource management. Allow for a single connection to a remote server to be shared across more than one application in the gateway providing the necessary topic partitioning. Configuration Service Leverage the OSGi specifications ConfigurationAdmin and MetaType to provide a snapshot service to import/export the configuration of all registered services in the container. Remote Management Allow for remote management of the IoT applications installed in Kura including their deployment, upgrade and configuration management. The Remote Management service relies on the Configuration Service and the Cloud Service. Networking Provide API for introspects and configure the network interfaces available in the gateway like Ethernet, Wifi, and Cellular modems. Watchdog Service Register critical components to the Watchdog Service, which will force a system reset through the hardware watchdog when a problem is detected. Web administration interface Offer a web-based management console running within the Kura container to manage the gateway. Drivers and Assets A unified model is introduced to simplify the communication with the devices attached to the gateway. The Driver encapsulates the communication protocol and its configuration parameters, while the Asset, which is generic across Drivers, models the information data channels towards the device. When an Asset is created, a Mirror of the device is automatically available for on-demand read and writes via Java APIs or via Cloud through remote messages. Wires Offers modular and visual data flow programming tool to define data collection and processing pipelines at the edge by simply selecting components from a palette and wiring them together. This way users can, for example, configure an Asset, periodically acquire data from its channels, store them in the gateway, filter or aggregate them using powerful SQL queries, and send the results to the Cloud.

The Eclipse Kapua Web Console provides the administration tools used for the management of the built-in services exposed by Kura. To remotely manage a device running Kura through the Eclipse Kapua Web Console, select the desired device from the Devices Table of the console and open the Configuration tab as shown in the screen capture below. Please refer to the Built-in Services section for a description of the available Services and their configuration parameters. Installation of a New Application As described in Application Management , a new application embedded in a deployment package can be deployed and configured using Eclipse Kapua Console. To do so, select a connected device and click on the Packages tab. Then, click on Install/Upgrade . The Install New Package window opens allowing the deployment package to be installed from an URL as shown in the screen capture below. Once installed, the new application parameters may be modified in the same way as the Built-in Services. Click on the Configuration tab to see the service that corresponds to your application. Snapshots As described in Snapshot Management , the overall Kura configuration, including the new installed applications, is stored in a snapshot xml file. The Eclipse Kapua Console also provides options to Download , Upload and Apply , or Rollback snapshots as shown in the screen capture below. Remote Command Execution from Eclipse Kapua Web Console The Eclipse Kapua Console provides the ability to run system commands directly on the device. Refer to Command Service for details on how to configure this service in Kura. It is also possible to send a script to execute using the File option of the Command tab in Eclipse Kapua Console as shown in the screen capture below. This script must be compressed into a zip file with the eventual associated resource files. Once the file is selected, click Execute . The zip file is sent embedded in an MQTT message on the device.

The Kura ExamplePublisher will be used as a reference. The application should bind itself to a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance, this can be done in different ways, such as using OSGi ServiceTracker s or by leveraging the Declarative Service layer. The recommended way to perform this operation is choosing the latter and allowing the user to customize the service references through component configuration. If the component metatype and definition are structured as described below, the Kura Web UI will show a dedicated widget in component configuration that helps the user to pick compatible CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instances. Write component definition The first step involves declaring the Publisher or Subscriber references in component definition: <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" activate= \"activate\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" modified= \"updated\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" configuration-policy= \"require\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <!-- If the component is configurable through the Kura ConfigurationService, it must expose a Service. --> <property name= \"service.pid\" type= \"String\" value= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\" /> </service> <reference name= \"CloudPublisher\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudPublisher\" unbind= \"unsetCloudPublisher\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.publisher.CloudPublisher\" /> <reference name= \"CloudSubscriber\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudSubscriber\" unbind= \"unsetCloudSubscriber\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.subscriber.CloudSubscriber\" /> </scr:component> The snipped above shows the definition of Kura ExamplePublisher, this component is capable of sending and receiving messages, and therefore defines two references, the first to a CloudPublisher and the second to a CloudSubscriber . In order to allow the user to customize the bindings at runtime, the target attribute of the references should not be specified at this point in component definition, as it will be set by the Web UI. Reference cardinality should be use the 0..1 or 0..n form, as it is not guaranteed that the references will point to a valid service instance during all the lifetime of the application component. For example, references can not be bound if the application has not been configured by the user yet or if the target service is missing. Create component metatype Application metatype should declare an AD for each Publisher/Subscriber reference declared in component definition: <MetaData xmlns= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/metatype/v1.2.0\" localization= \"en_us\" > <OCD id= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" name= \"ExamplePublisher\" description= \"Example of a Configuring Kura Application.\" > <!-- ... --> <AD id= \"CloudPublisher.target\" name= \"CloudPublisher Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Publisher used to publish messages to the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <AD id= \"CloudSubscriber.target\" name= \"CloudSubscriber Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Subscriber used to receive messages from the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <!-- ... --> </OCD> <Designate pid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" factoryPid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" > <Object ocdref= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> </Designate> </MetaData> It is important to respect the following rules for some of the AD attributes: id This attribute must have the following form: <reference name>.target where <reference name> should match the value of the name attribute of the corresponding reference in component definition. required must be set to true default must not be empty and must be a valid OSGi filter. The Web UI will renderer a dedicated widget for picking CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances: Write the bind/unbind methods in applicaiton code The last step involves defining some bind...() / unbind...() methods with a name that matches the values of the bind / unbind attributes of the references in component definition. public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } As stated above, since reference cardinality is declared as 0.. , the application must be prepared to handle the cases where references are not satisfied, and therefore CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances are not available. Publish a message If a CloudPublisher instance is bound, the application can publish messages using its publish() method: if ( nonNull ( this . cloudPublisher )) { KuraMessage message = new KuraMessage ( payload ); String messageId = this . cloudPublisher . publish ( message ); } Receiving messages using a CloudSubscriber In order to receive messages from a CloudSubscriber , the application must implement and attach a CloudSubscriberListener to it. This can be done for example during CloudSubscriber binding: public class ExamplePublisher implements CloudSubscriberListener , ... { ... public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { this . cloudSubscriber = cloudSubscriber ; this . cloudSubscriber . registerCloudSubscriberListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { this . cloudSubscriber . unregisterCloudSubscriberListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... this . cloudSubscriber = null ; } ... @Override public void onMessageArrived ( KuraMessage message ) { logReceivedMessage ( message ); } ... } The CloudSubscriber will invoke the onMessageArrived() method when new messages are received. Receiving connection state notifications If an application is interested in cloud connection status change events (connected, disconnected, etc), it can implement and attach a CloudConnectionListener to a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance. public class ExamplePublisher implements CloudConnectionListener , ... { ... public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { this . cloudPublisher = cloudPublisher ; this . cloudPublisher . registerCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { this . cloudPublisher . unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); ... this . cloudPublisher = null ; } public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { this . cloudSubscriber = cloudSubscriber ; ... this . cloudSubscriber . registerCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... this . cloudSubscriber . unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); this . cloudSubscriber = null ; } ... @Override public void onConnectionEstablished () { logger . info ( \"Connection established\" ); } @Override public void onConnectionLost () { logger . warn ( \"Connection lost!\" ); } @Override public void onDisconnected () { logger . warn ( \"On disconnected\" ); } ... } Receiving message delivery notifications If an application is interested in message confirmation events and the underlying cloud connection supports it, it can implement and attach a CloudDeliveryListener to a CloudPublisher instance. public class ExamplePublisher implements CloudDeliveryListener , ... { ... public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { this . cloudPublisher = cloudPublisher ; ... this . cloudPublisher . registerCloudDeliveryListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... this . cloudPublisher . registerCloudDeliveryListener ( ExamplePublisher . this ); this . cloudPublisher = null ; } ... @Override public void onMessageConfirmed ( String messageId ) { logger . info ( \"Confirmed message with id: {}\" , messageId ); } ... } The CloudSubscriber will invoke the onMessageConfirmed() method when a published message is confirmed. In order to determine which message has been confirmed, the provided messageId can be compared with the id returned by the publish() call that published the message. Please note that if the underlying cloud connection is not able to provide message confirmation for the published message, the id returned by publish() will be null .","title":"Application Developer Guide"},{"location":"cloud-api/app-dev-guide/#application-developer-guide","text":"This guide will provide information on how an application developer can leverage the new Generic Cloud Services APIs, in order to be able to properly use the CloudPublisher/CloudSubscriber API, publish a message, being notified of message delivery and of connection status changes. The Kura ExamplePublisher will be used as a reference. The application should bind itself to a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance, this can be done in different ways, such as using OSGi ServiceTracker s or by leveraging the Declarative Service layer. The recommended way to perform this operation is choosing the latter and allowing the user to customize the service references through component configuration. If the component metatype and definition are structured as described below, the Kura Web UI will show a dedicated widget in component configuration that helps the user to pick compatible CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instances. Write component definition The first step involves declaring the Publisher or Subscriber references in component definition: <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" activate= \"activate\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" modified= \"updated\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" configuration-policy= \"require\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <!-- If the component is configurable through the Kura ConfigurationService, it must expose a Service. --> <property name= \"service.pid\" type= \"String\" value= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\" /> </service> <reference name= \"CloudPublisher\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudPublisher\" unbind= \"unsetCloudPublisher\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.publisher.CloudPublisher\" /> <reference name= \"CloudSubscriber\" policy= \"static\" bind= \"setCloudSubscriber\" unbind= \"unsetCloudSubscriber\" cardinality= \"0..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.subscriber.CloudSubscriber\" /> </scr:component> The snipped above shows the definition of Kura ExamplePublisher, this component is capable of sending and receiving messages, and therefore defines two references, the first to a CloudPublisher and the second to a CloudSubscriber . In order to allow the user to customize the bindings at runtime, the target attribute of the references should not be specified at this point in component definition, as it will be set by the Web UI. Reference cardinality should be use the 0..1 or 0..n form, as it is not guaranteed that the references will point to a valid service instance during all the lifetime of the application component. For example, references can not be bound if the application has not been configured by the user yet or if the target service is missing. Create component metatype Application metatype should declare an AD for each Publisher/Subscriber reference declared in component definition: <MetaData xmlns= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/metatype/v1.2.0\" localization= \"en_us\" > <OCD id= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" name= \"ExamplePublisher\" description= \"Example of a Configuring Kura Application.\" > <!-- ... --> <AD id= \"CloudPublisher.target\" name= \"CloudPublisher Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Publisher used to publish messages to the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <AD id= \"CloudSubscriber.target\" name= \"CloudSubscriber Target Filter\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"(kura.service.pid=changeme)\" description= \"Specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the Cloud Subscriber used to receive messages from the cloud platform.\" > </AD> <!-- ... --> </OCD> <Designate pid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" factoryPid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" > <Object ocdref= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.publisher.ExamplePublisher\" /> </Designate> </MetaData> It is important to respect the following rules for some of the AD attributes: id This attribute must have the following form: <reference name>.target where <reference name> should match the value of the name attribute of the corresponding reference in component definition. required must be set to true default must not be empty and must be a valid OSGi filter. The Web UI will renderer a dedicated widget for picking CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances: Write the bind/unbind methods in applicaiton code The last step involves defining some bind...() / unbind...() methods with a name that matches the values of the bind / unbind attributes of the references in component definition. public void setCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void unsetCloudPublisher ( CloudPublisher cloudPublisher ) { ... } public void setCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } public void unsetCloudSubscriber ( CloudSubscriber cloudSubscriber ) { ... } As stated above, since reference cardinality is declared as 0.. , the application must be prepared to handle the cases where references are not satisfied, and therefore CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber instances are not available.

The following sections describe the services and how to configure them. The CloudService API is deprecated since Kura 4.0. The functionalities provided by CloudService are now provided by the CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager service interfaces. See the section describing the Kura 4.0 cloud connection model for more details. The DataService and MqttDataTrasport APIs are not deprecated in Kura 4.0. CloudService The CloudService provides an easy-to-use API layer for the M2M application to communicate with a remote server. It operates as a decorator for the DataService, providing add-on features over the management of the transport layer. In addition to simple publish/subscribe, the CloudService API simplifies the implementation of more complex interaction flows like request/response or remote resource management. The CloudService abstracts the developers from the complexity of the transport protocol and payload format used in the communication. The CloudService allows a single connection to a remote server to be shared across more than one application in the gateway providing the necessary topic partitioning. Its functions include: Adds application topic prefixes to allow for a single remote server connection to be shared across applications. Defines a payload data model and provides default encoding/decoding serializers. Publishes life-cycle messages when the device and applications start and stop. To use this service, select the CloudServices option located in the System area and select the CloudService tab as shown in the screen capture below. The CloudService provides the following configuration parameters: device.display-name - defines the device display name given by the system. (Required field.) device.custom-name - defines the custom device display name if the device.display-name parameter is set to \"Custom\". topic.control-prefix - defines the topic prefix for system messages. encode.gzip - defines if the message payloads are sent compressed. republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.gps.lock - when set to true, forces a republish of the MQTT Birth Certificate when a GPS correct position lock is received. The device is then registered with its real coordinates. (Required field.) republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect - when set to true, forces a republish of the MQTT Birth Certificate when the service receives a modem detection event. (Required field.) enable.default.subscriptions - when set to true, the gateway will not be remotely manageable. birth.cert.policy - specify the birth certificate policy. The options are Disable publishing , Publish birth on connect and Publish birth on connect and reconnect . payload.encoding - Specify the message payload encoding. The possible options are Kura Protobuf and Simple JSON . DataService The DataService provides the ability to connect to a remote broker, publish messages, subscribe to topics, receive messages on the subscribed topics, and disconnect from the remote message broker. The DataService delegates to the MqttDataTransport service the implementation of the transport protocol that is used to interact with the remote server. The DataService also adds the capability of storing published messages in a persistent store function and sending them over the wire at a later time. The purpose of this feature is to relieve service users from implementing their own persistent store. Service users may publish messages independently on the DataService connection status. In order to overcome the potential latencies introduced by buffering messages, the DataService allows a priority level to be assigned for each published message. Depending on the store configuration, there are certain guarantees that stored messages are not lost due to sudden crashes or power outages. To use this service, select the DataService option located in the System area and select the CloudService tab as shown in the screen capture below. The DataService offers methods and configuration options to manage the connection to the remote server including the following (all required) parameters described below. connect.auto-on-startup - when set to true, the service tries to auto-connect to the remote server on start-up and restore the connection every time the device is disconnected. These attempts are made at the frequency defined in the connect.retry-interval parameter until the connection is established. disconnect.quiesce-timeout - allows the delivery of in-flight messages to be completed before disconnecting from the broker when a disconnection from the broker is being forced. store.housekeeper-interval - defines the interval in seconds used to run the Data Store housekeeper task. store.purge-age - defines the age in seconds of completed messages (either published with QoS = 0 or confirmed with QoS > 0) after which they are deleted (minimum 5). store.capacity - defines the maximum number of messages persisted in the Data Store. in-flight-messages parameters - define the management of messages that have been published and not yet confirmed, including: in-flight-messages.republish-on-new-session in-flight-messages.max-number in-flight-messages.congestion-timeout MqttDataTransport The MqttDataTransport service provides the ability to connect to a remote broker, publish messages, subscribe to topics, receive messages on the subscribed topics, and disconnect from the remote message broker. To use this service, select the MqttDataTransport option located in the System area and select the CloudService tab as shown in the screen capture below. The MqttDataTransport service provides the following configuration parameters: broker-url - defines the URL of the MQTT broker to connect to. (Required field.) topic.context.account-name - defines the name of the account to which the device belongs. username and password - define the username and password that have been assigned to the device by the account administrator (generally username is account-name_broker). (Required field.) client-id - defines the identifier of the MQTT client representing the device when connecting to the MQTT broker. If left empty, it is automatically determined by the client software as the MAC address of the main network interface (in general numbers and uppercase letters without ':'). This identifier has to be unique within your account. keep-alive - defines the \"keep alive\" interval measured in seconds. It specifies the maximum amount of time that should pass without communication between the client and the server. The client will ensure that at least one message travels across the network within each keep alive period. In the absence of a data-related message during this time period, the client will send a very small MQTT \"ping\" message that the server will acknowledge. The keep alive interval enables the client to detect when the server is no longer available without having to wait for the long TCP/IP timeout. (Required field.) timeout - sets the timeout used for all interactions with the MQTT broker. (Required field.) clean-session - controls the behavior of both the client and the server at the time of connect and disconnect. When this parameter is set to true, the state information is discarded at connect and disconnect; when set to false, the state information is maintained. (Required field.) lwt parameters - define the MQTT \"Last Will and Testament\" (LWT) settings for the client. In the event that the client unexpectedly loses its connection to the server, the server publishes the LWT message (lwt.payload) to the LWT topic on behalf of the client. This allows other clients (subscribed to the LWT topic) to be made aware that the client has disconnected. LWT parameters that may be configured include: lwt.topic lwt.payload lwt.qos lwt.retain in-flight.persistence - defines the storage type where in-flight messages are persisted across reconnections. They may be stored in memory, or in a file on the disk. (Required field.) protocol-version - defines the MQTT Protocol version to be used.

As reference, this guide will use the Eclipse IoT WG namespace implementation bundle available here Implement CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager In order to leverage the new APIs, and be managed by the Kura Web UI, the Cloud Connection implementation bundle must implement CloudEndpont and, if log-lived connections are supported, the CloudConnectionManager interface must be implemented as well. The ending class should be something as follows: public class CloudConnectionManagerImpl implements CloudConnectionManager , CloudEndpoint , ... { @Override public boolean isConnected () { ... } @Override public void connect () throws KuraConnectException { ... } @Override public void disconnect () { ... } @Override public Map < String , String > getInfo () { ... } @Override public void registerCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ) { ... } @Override public void unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ) { ... } } A corresponding component definition should be provided in the OSGI-INF folder exposing the implementation of CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager interfaces. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" activate= \"activate\" configuration-policy= \"require\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" modified= \"updated\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.eclipseiot.mqtt.ConnectionManager\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.internal.cloudconnection.eclipseiot.mqtt.cloud.CloudConnectionManagerImpl\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\" /> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudConnectionManager\" /> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudEndpoint\" /> <!-- ... --> </service> <!-- ... --> <property name= \"kura.ui.service.hide\" type= \"Boolean\" value= \"true\" /> <property name= \"kura.ui.factory.hide\" type= \"String\" value= \"true\" /> </scr:component> In order to be fully compliant with the Web UI requirements, the CloudConnection component definition should provide two properties kura.ui.service.hide and kura.ui.factory.hide to hide the component from the left side part of the UI dedicated to display the services list. Implement the CloudConnectionFactory interface The CloudConnectionFactory is responsible to manage the cloud connection instance lifecycle by creating the CloudEndpoint instance and all the required services needed to publish or receive messages from the cloud platform. As a reference, please have a look at the CloudConnectionFactory defined for the Eclipse IoT WG namespace implementation. In particular, the getFactoryPid() method returns the PID of the CloudEndpoint factory. The createConfiguration() method receives a PID that will be used for the instantiation of the CloudEndpoint and for all the related services required to communicate with the cloud platform. In the example above, the factory creates the CloudEnpoint, and a DataService and MqttDataTransport instances internally needed to communicate with a remote cloud platform. As can be seen here , the CloudEndpoint instance configuration is enriched with the reference to the CloudConnectionFactory that generated it. This step is required by the Web UI in order to properly relate the instances with the corresponding factories. The deleteConfiguration() method deletes from the framework the CloudEndpoint instance identified by the PID passed as argument and all the related services. In the Eclipse IOT WG example, it not only deletes the CloudEndpoint instance but also the corresponding DataService and MqttDataTransport instances. The getStackComponentsPids() method return a List of String that represent the kura.service.pid of the configurable components that are part of a Cloud Connection instance. This method is used by the Web UI to get the list of configurable components that need to be displayed to the end user. The getManagedCloudConnectionPids() method will return the list of kura.service.pid of all the CloudEndpoints managed by the factory.

Motivations Before Kura 4.0, Cloud APIs were quite tied to Kapua messaging conventions and to the MQTT protocol. Defining custom stacks that support other cloud platforms was possible, but the resulting implementations were affected by the following limitations: The legacy APIs assume that the underlying messaging protocol is MQTT. This assumption spans across all API layers, from the low level MQTTDataTrasport to the high level CloudClient . This makes quite difficult to implement cloud stacks that use other protocols like AMQP or HTTP. The CloudClient API, which was the recommended way for applications to interface with a cloud stack, enforce the following MQTT topic structure: #account-name/#device-id/#app-id/<app-topic> This topic hierarchy, which is Kapua related, might be too restrictive or too loose for other cloud platforms, for example: The Eclipse IoT working group namespace allows authenticated devices to omit the accont-name and device-id parameters in the topic. Moreover, telemetry, alert and event message topics must start respectively the t/ , a/ and e/ prefixes. Adhering to this specification is not possible for a cloud stack that implements the legacy APIs. The AWS cloud platform allows publishing on virtually any topic, using a CloudClient would be quite restrictive in this case. A way for overcoming this limitation for an application might be using the DataService layer directly, adversely affecting portability. The Cumulocity cloud platform allows publishing only on a limited set of topics, and most of the application generated information is placed in the payload encoded in CSV. Using CloudClient in this case makes difficult for the cloud stack to enforce that the messages are published on the correct topics. Moreover, the cloud stack in this case must also convert from KuraPayload to CSV, this can be currently achieved only by introducing rigid conversion rules, that might not be enough to support all message formats. Applications that use the current APIs are not portable across cloud platforms. For example if an appliaction intends to publish on Cumulocity or AWS, it should be probably aware of the underlying cloud platform. Concepts The main interfaces of the new set of APIs and their interactions are depicted in the diagram below: As shown in the above diagram new APIs introduce the concept of Cloud Connection , a set of related services that allow to manage the communication to/from a remote cloud platform. The services that compose a Cloud Connection can implement the following cloud-specific interfaces: CloudEndpoint (required): Each Cloud Connection is identified by a single instance of CloudEndpoint that implements low level specificities for the communication with the remote cloud platform. CloudConnectionManager (optional): Exposes methods that allow to manage long-lived connections. The implementor of CloudEndpoint can implement this interface as well if the cloud platform support long-lived connections (for example by using the MQTT protocol). RequestHandlerRegistry (optional): Manages the command and control functionalities if supported by the cloud platform. CloudPublisher (optional): Allows applications to publish messages to the cloud platform in a portable way. CloudSubscriber (optional): Allows applications to receive messages from the cloud platform in a portable way. CloudConnectionFactory (required): Manages the lifecycle of Cloud Connections. A Cloud Connection can also include services that do not provide any of the interfaces above but compose the internal implementation. CloudEndpoint Every Cloud Connection must contain a single CloudEndpoint instance. The kura.service.pid of the CloudEndpoint identifies the whole Cloud Connection. The CloudEndpoint provides some low level methods that can be used to interact with the remote cloud platform. For example the interface provides the publish() and subscribe() methods that allow to publish or receive messages from the cloud platform in form of KuraMessage s. Those methods are designed for internal use and are not intended to be used by end-user applications. The format of the KuraMessage provided to/received from a CloudEndpoint is implementation specific: the CloudEndpoint expects some properties to be set in the KuraMessage to be able to correctly publish a message (e.g. MQTT topic). These properties are specified by the particular CloudEndpoint , and should be documented by the implementor. The recommended way for applications to publish and receive messages involves using the Publisher and Subscriber APIs described below. If an application directly uses the methods above, it will lose portability and will be tied to the specific Cloud Connection implementation. CloudConnectionManager If the messaging protocol implemented by a Cloud Connection supports long-lived connection, then its CloudEndpoint can also implement and provide the CloudConnectionManager interface. This interface exposes some methods that can be used to manage the connection like connect() , disconnect() and isConnected() ; it also supports monitoring connection state using the CloudConnectionListener interface. Publishers and Subscribers The limitations of the current model described above are addressed by the introduction of the CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber APIs, that replace the CloudClient as the recommended interface between applications and cloud stacks. CloudPublisher and CloudSubscriber are service interfaces defined as follows: public interface CloudPublisher { public String publish ( KuraMessage message ) throws KuraException ; public void registerCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); public void unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); public void registerCloudDeliveryListener ( CloudDeliveryListener cloudDeliveryListener ); public void unregisterCloudDeliveryListener ( CloudDeliveryListener cloudDeliveryListener ); } public interface CloudSubscriber { public void registerCloudSubscriberListener ( CloudSubscriberListener listener ); public void unregisterCloudSubscriberListener ( CloudSubscriberListener listener ); public void registerCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); public void unregisterCloudConnectionListener ( CloudConnectionListener cloudConnectionListener ); } CloudPublisher The CloudPublisher interface should be used by applications for publishing messages using the single publish() method. This method accepts a KuraMessage which is basically a KuraPayload that can be enriched with metadata. The main difference with the CloudClient APIs is that the publish() method does not require the application to specify any information related to message destinations. This allows to write portable applications that are unaware of the low level details of the destination cloud platform, such as the message format and the transport protocol. CloudSubscriber An application designed to receive messages from the cloud must now attach a listener ( CloudSubscriberListener ) to a CloudSubscriber instance. In this case, the message source cannot be specified by the application but is defined by the subscriber instance, in the same way as the CloudPublisher defines destination for published messages. The low level details necessary for message delivery and reception (e.g. the MQTT topic and the conversion between KuraMessage and the message format used on the wire) are managed by the publisher/subscriber, typically these details are stored in the service configuration. While in the previous model an application was responsible to actively obtain a CloudClient instance from a CloudService , now the relation between the application and a CloudPublisher or CloudSubscriber instance is represented as an OSGi service reference. Applications should allow the user to modify this reference in configuration, making it easy to switch between different cloud publisher/subscriber instances and different cloud platforms. Publisher/subscriber instances are now typically instantiated and configured by the end user using the Web UI. Publisher/subscriber instances are related to a CloudEnpoint instance using an OSGi service reference encoded in well known configuration property specified in the APIs ( CloudConnectionConstants.CLOUD_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_PID_PROP_NAME ). This allows the user to create those instances in a dedicated section of the Web UI. Command and control Another field in which the current Kura cloud related APIs can be generalized is related to command and control. In the previous model this aspect was covered by the Cloudlet APIs that are now replaced by RequestHandler APIs Legacy Cloudlet implementations are defined by extending a base class, Cloudlet , which takes care of handling the invocation of the doGet() , doPut() , doPost() ... methods, and of correlating request and response messages. Messages were sent and received through a CloudClient . More explicitly, Cloudlet only works with control topics whose structure is $EDC/<account-name>/<device-id>/<app-id>/<method>/<resource-path> and also expects the identifier of the sender and the correlation identifier in the KuraPayload . In the previous model, there is no way for a cloud stack implementor to customize the aspects above, which are hardcoded in the Cloudlet base class. The new model delegates these aspects to some component of the cloud stack, and requires applications that want to support command and control to register themselves as RequestHandler to a RequestHandlerRegistry instance. In order to ease porting old applications to the new model, some of the concepts of the old Cloudlet APIs are still present, this can be seen by looking at the RequestHandler interface definition: public interface RequestHandler { public KuraMessage doGet ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPut ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPost ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doDel ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doExec ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; } A RequestHandler invocation involves the following parameters: Request parameters: method : (GET, PUT, POST, DEL, EXEC) that identifies the RequestHandler method to be called request message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the KuraMessage . resources : A List<String> of positional parameters available under the well known args key in the provided KuraMessage properties. Response parameters: response message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the returned KuraMessage . status : A numeric code reporting operation completion state, determined as follows: 200, if RequestHandler methods returns without throwing exceptions. 400, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == BAD_REQUEST 404, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == NOT_FOUND 500, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with other error codes. exception message : The message of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. exception stack trace : The stack trace of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. The parameters above are the same involved in current Cloudlet calls. The request id and requester client id parameters are no longer part of the API, because are related to the to the way Kapua correlates requests and response. In the new API, request and response identifiers are not specified and not forwarded to the Cloudlet, this allows the CloudletService implementation to adopt the platform specific conventions for message correlation. The Cloudlet parameters must be present in the request and response messages encoded in some format. A user that intends to call a Kura Cloudlet, for example through platform-specific REST APIs must be aware of these parameters. The user must supply request parameters in request message and must be able to extract response data from received message. The actual encoding of these parameters inside the messages depends on the particular platform. The fact that set of Cloudlet parameters are roughly the same involved in current Cloudlet calls allows existing Cloudlet based applications to continue to work without changes to the protocol. Cloud Connection lifecycle CloudEndpoint instance lifecycle is managed by a CloudConnectionFactory instance. A cloud connection implementor must register a CloudConnectionFactory instance in the framework that is responsible of creating and destroying the CloudEndpoint instances. The CloudConnectionFactory will be typically invoked by the Web UI, and is defined as follows: public interface CloudConnectionFactory { public static final String KURA_CLOUD_CONNECTION_FACTORY_PID = \"kura.cloud.connection.factory.pid\" ; public String getFactoryPid (); public void createConfiguration ( String pid ) throws KuraException ; public List < String > getStackComponentsPids ( String pid ) throws KuraException ; public void deleteConfiguration ( String pid ) throws KuraException ; public Set < String > getManagedCloudConnectionPids () throws KuraException ; } The createConfiguration() and deleteConfiguration() methods are responsible of creating/destroying a CloudEndpoint instance, specified by the provided kura.service.pid , and all the related services. The getManagedCloudConnectionPids() returns the set of kura.service.pid managed by the factory. The getStackComponentsPids(String pid) returns the list of the kura.service.pid s of the ConfigurableComponent s that are associated with the CloudEndpoint with the specified pid. The Web Ui will render the configuration of those components in separated tabs, in the dedicated CloudConnections section. Backwards compatibility In order to ease the transition to the new model, legacy APIs like CloudService and CloudClient are still supported in Kura 4.0.0, even if deprecated. The default Kapua oriented CloudService implementation is still available and can be used by legacy applications without changes. The default CloudService instance in Kura 4.0 also implements the new CloudEndpoint and CloudConnectionManager interfaces.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#overview","text":"This section describes the new cloud related concepts and APIs introduced in Kura 4.0.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#motivations","text":"Before Kura 4.0, Cloud APIs were quite tied to Kapua messaging conventions and to the MQTT protocol.

Applications should allow the user to modify this reference in configuration, making it easy to switch between different cloud publisher/subscriber instances and different cloud platforms. Publisher/subscriber instances are now typically instantiated and configured by the end user using the Web UI. Publisher/subscriber instances are related to a CloudEnpoint instance using an OSGi service reference encoded in well known configuration property specified in the APIs ( CloudConnectionConstants.CLOUD_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_PID_PROP_NAME ). This allows the user to create those instances in a dedicated section of the Web UI.","title":"CloudSubscriber"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#command-and-control","text":"Another field in which the current Kura cloud related APIs can be generalized is related to command and control. In the previous model this aspect was covered by the Cloudlet APIs that are now replaced by RequestHandler APIs Legacy Cloudlet implementations are defined by extending a base class, Cloudlet , which takes care of handling the invocation of the doGet() , doPut() , doPost() ... methods, and of correlating request and response messages. Messages were sent and received through a CloudClient . More explicitly, Cloudlet only works with control topics whose structure is $EDC/<account-name>/<device-id>/<app-id>/<method>/<resource-path> and also expects the identifier of the sender and the correlation identifier in the KuraPayload . In the previous model, there is no way for a cloud stack implementor to customize the aspects above, which are hardcoded in the Cloudlet base class. The new model delegates these aspects to some component of the cloud stack, and requires applications that want to support command and control to register themselves as RequestHandler to a RequestHandlerRegistry instance. In order to ease porting old applications to the new model, some of the concepts of the old Cloudlet APIs are still present, this can be seen by looking at the RequestHandler interface definition: public interface RequestHandler { public KuraMessage doGet ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPut ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doPost ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doDel ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; public KuraMessage doExec ( RequestHandlerContext context , KuraMessage reqMessage ) throws KuraException ; } A RequestHandler invocation involves the following parameters: Request parameters: method : (GET, PUT, POST, DEL, EXEC) that identifies the RequestHandler method to be called request message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the KuraMessage . resources : A List<String> of positional parameters available under the well known args key in the provided KuraMessage properties. Response parameters: response message : A set of key-value pairs and/or binary body contained in the KuraPayload wrapped inside the returned KuraMessage . status : A numeric code reporting operation completion state, determined as follows: 200, if RequestHandler methods returns without throwing exceptions. 400, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == BAD_REQUEST 404, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with KuraErrorCode == NOT_FOUND 500, if RequestHandler methods throws a KuraException with other error codes. exception message : The message of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. exception stack trace : The stack trace of the KuraException thrown by the RequestHandler methods, if any. The parameters above are the same involved in current Cloudlet calls. The request id and requester client id parameters are no longer part of the API, because are related to the to the way Kapua correlates requests and response. In the new API, request and response identifiers are not specified and not forwarded to the Cloudlet, this allows the CloudletService implementation to adopt the platform specific conventions for message correlation. The Cloudlet parameters must be present in the request and response messages encoded in some format. A user that intends to call a Kura Cloudlet, for example through platform-specific REST APIs must be aware of these parameters. The user must supply request parameters in request message and must be able to extract response data from received message. The actual encoding of these parameters inside the messages depends on the particular platform. The fact that set of Cloudlet parameters are roughly the same involved in current Cloudlet calls allows existing Cloudlet based applications to continue to work without changes to the protocol.","title":"Command and control"},{"location":"cloud-api/overview/#cloud-connection-lifecycle","text":"CloudEndpoint instance lifecycle is managed by a CloudConnectionFactory instance. A cloud connection implementor must register a CloudConnectionFactory instance in the framework that is responsible of creating and destroying the CloudEndpoint instances.

Prerequisites In order to connect a device to Amazon AWS IoT Kura version 1.3 or greater is required. An Amazon AWS account is also needed. Device registration The first step involves the registration of the new device on AWS, this operation can be done using the AWS Web Console or with the AWS CLI command line tool, in this guide the Web based console will be used. 1. Access the AWS IoT management console. This can be done by logging in the AWS console and selecting IoT Core from the services list, in the Internet of Things section. 2. Create a default policy for the device. This step involves creating a default policy for the new device, skip if an existing policy is already available. Access the main screen of the console and select Secure -> Policies from the left side menu and then press the Create button, in the top right area of the screen. Fill the form as follows and then press the Create button: Action -> iot:Connect, iot:Publish, iot:Subscribe, iot:Receive, iot:UpdateThingShadow, iot:GetThingShadow, iot:DeleteThingShadow Resource ARN -> * Effect -> Allow This will create a policy that allows a device to connect to the platform, publish/subscribe on any topic and manage its thing shadow . 3. Register a new device. Devices on the AWS IoT platform are called things , in order to register a new thing select Manage -> Things from the left side menu and then press the Create button, in the top right section of the screen. Select Create a single thing . Enter a name for the new device and then press the Next button, from now on kura-gateway will be used as the device name. 4. Create a new certificate for the device. The AWS IoT platform uses SSL mutual authentication, for this reason it is necessary to download a public/private key pair for the device and a server certificate. Click on Create certificate to quickly generate a new certificate for the new device. Certificates can be managed later on by clicking on Secure -> Certificates , in the left part of the console. 5. Download the device SSL keys. You should see a screen like the following: Download the 3 files listed in the table and store them in a safe place, they will be needed later, also copy the link to the root CA for AWS IoT in order to be able to retrieve it later from the device. Press the Activate button, and then on Attach a policy . 6. Assign the default policy to the device. Select the desired policy and then click on Register thing . A policy can also be attached to a certificate later on perforiming the following steps: Enter the device configuration section, by clicking on Manage -> Things and then clicking on the newly created device. Click on Security on the left panel and then click on the certificate entry (it is identified by an hex code), select Policies in the left menu, you should see this screen: Click on Actions in the top left section of the page and then click on Attach policy , select the default policy previously created and then press the Attach button. Device configuration The following steps should be performed on the device, this guide is based on Kura 3.1.0 version and has been tested on a Raspberry PI 3. 7. Create a Java keystore on the device. The first step for using the device keys obtained at the previous step is to create a new Java keystore containing the Root Certificate used by the Amazon IoT platform, this can be done executing the following commands on the device: sudo mkdir /opt/eclipse/kura/security cd /opt/eclipse/kura/security curl https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem > /tmp/root-CA.pem sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias aws -file /tmp/root-CA.pem -keystore cacerts.ks -storepass changeit If the last command reports that the certificate already exist in the system-wide store type yes to proceed. The code above will generate a new keystore with changeit as password, change it if needed. 8. Configure the SSL parameters using the Kura Web UI. Open the Kura Web Console and enter select the Settings entry in the left side menu and then click on SSL Configuration , you should see this screen: Change the Keystore path parameter to /opt/eclipse/kura/security/cacerts.ks if needed. Change the settings in the form to match the screen above, set Default protocol to TLSv1.2 , enter changeit as Keystore Password (or the password defined at step 7). Warning Steps from 8.2 to 8.6 will not work on Kura 3.2.0 due to a known issue . On this version, private key and device certificate need to be manually added to the keystore using the command line. If you are running Kura 3.2.0, proceed with step 8.7. Open the Kura Web Console and enter select the Settings entry in the left side menu and then click on Device SSL Certificate , you should see this screen: Enter aws-ssl in the Storage Alias field. The private key needs to be converted to the PKCS8 format, this step can be performed executing the following command on a Linux or OSX based machine: openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key -out outKey.pem -nocrypt where xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key is the file containing the private key downloaded at step 4. Paste the contents of the obtained outKey.pem in the \"Private Key\" field. Paste the contents of xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt in the Certificate field. You should see a screen like this Click the Apply button to confirm. Kura 3.2.0 only - manually import device certificate and private key into keystore. On the host machine, open a terminal window in the folder containing the files downloaded at step 5 and execute the following command: openssl pkcs12 -export -in xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt -inkey xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key -name aws-ssl -out aws-ssl.p12 where xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt is the original certificate downloaded from AWS and xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key is the private key. The command will ask for a password, define a new password. Copy the obtained aws-ssl.p12 file to the device into the /tmp folder using scp: scp ./aws-ssl.p12 pi@<device-address>:/tmp Replacing <device-address> with the hostname or ip address of the device. Open a ssh connection to the device and enter the following command: sudo keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass changeit -destkeystore /opt/eclipse/kura/security/cacerts.ks -srckeystore /tmp/aws-ssl.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 The command will ask for a password, enter the password defined when creating the aws-ssl.p12 file. Restart Kura to reload the keystore. 9. Setup a new cloud connection Click on Cloud Connections in the left panel, and setup a new cloud connection Click on the New Connection button at the top of the page and set the following parameters in the dialog: Cloud Connection Factory PID -> org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService Cloud Connection Service PID -> org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService-AWS Press the Create button to confirm and then select the newly created CloudService instance from the list. Set the broker URL in the MqttDataTransport-AWS tab, it can be obtained from the AWS IoT Web Console clicking on the Settings entry in the bottom left section of the page, the URL will look like the following: a1rm1xxxxxxxxx.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The mqtts protocol must be used, the value for the broker-url field derived from the URL above is the following: mqtts://a1rm1xxxxxxxxx.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883/ Clear the value of the username and password fields. Set a value for the topic.context.account-name and client-id . Assign an arbitrary account name to topic.context.account-name (for example aws-test ), this will be used by the CloudClient instances for building the topic structure. Enter the thing name in the client-id field (in this example kura-gateway ). In order for the previously added keys to be used for the SSL connection with the broker enter the Storage Alias defined in step 8.2 (e.g aws-ssl ) as value for the ssl.certificate.alias field. The setting lwt.topic under MqttDataTransport-AWS needs to be updated as well by entering a value not containing the $ character. This is required because of the fact that AWS IoT does not support topic names starting with $ (except for the $aws/ hierarchy). Press the Apply button in the top left section to commit the changes to the MqttDataTransport-AWS . Enter a name without the $ character for the topic.control-prefix setting in the CloudService-AWS tab, for example aws-control . The Kura CloudService uses some well-known topics to allow remote device management and to report device state information, this features are not supported by default by AWS IoT, the following settings can be applied in the CloudService-AWS tab in order to avoid sending unnecessary messages: republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.gps.lock -> false republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect -> false enable.default.subscriptions -> false birth.cert.policy -> Disable publishing Click the Apply button to save the changes. 10.

When doing so, Kura applications can send device-to-cloud messages. More information on the Azure IoT Hub and its support for the MQTT protocol can be found here . This document outlines how to configure and connect a Kura application to the Azure IoT Hub. Get Azure IoT Hub information In order to properly configure Kura to connect to IoT Hub, some information are needed. You will need the hostname of the Azure IoT Hub, referred below as {iothubhostname} , the Id and the SAS Token of the device, referred as {device_id} and {device_SAS_token} . The hostname is listed on the \"Overview\" tab on the IoT Hub main page, while the device ID is shown on the \"Device Explorer\" tab. Finally, the SAS token can be generated using the iothub-explorer application that can be found here . To install the application, type on a shell: npm install -g iothub-explorer Then start a new session on your IoT Hub instance (it will expire in 1 hour): iothub-explorer login \"{your-connection-string}\" where {your-connection-string} is the connection string of your IoT Hub instance. It can be found on the \"Shared access policies\" tab under \"Settings\". Select the \"iothubowner\" policy and a tab will appear with the \"Connection string\u2014primary key\" option. Then list your devices: iothub-explorer list and get the SAS token for the {device-name} device: iothub-explorer sas-token { device-name } Be aware that the SAS token will expire in 1 hour by default, but using \"-d\" option it is possible to set a custom expiration time. SSL certificates In order to connect to your IoT Hub instance, Kura should trust the remote broker through a SSL certificate. The simpler way to get the IotHub certificate is to run the following command on a shell: openssl s_client -showcerts -tls1 -connect { iothubhostname } :8883 The result is the SSL certificate chain. Copy all the certificates in the format: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE----- and paste them in to the \"Server SSL Certificate\" tab under \"Settings\" in Kura. Then click the Apply button and restart Kura to update the keystore. Configuring a Kura Cloud Stack for Azure IoT Hub The Kura Gateway Administrative Console exposes all services necessary to configure a connection to the Azure IoT Hub. You can follow the steps outlined below to configure the connection to the Azure IoT Hub. The first step is to create a new Kura Cloud stack.

The default component name for this component is kura-cloud but it may be overridden in the following use cases. The default component will only be registered once the default Kura Cloud API is registered with OSGi. This instance is registered with the OSGi property kura.service.pid=org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService . If you want to publish to a different cloud service instance you can either manually register a new instance of this endpoint, or e.g. use a functionality like the Simple XML router provides: also see selecting a cloud service . Endpoint URI The URI syntax of the endpoint is (assuming the default component name): kura-cloud:appid/topic . Where appid is the application ID registered with the Cloud API and topic is the topic to use. The following URI parameters are supported by the endpoint: Name Type Default Description applicationId String From URI path The application ID used with the Cloud API topic String From URI path The default topic name to publish/subscribe to when no header value is specified qos Integer 0 The QoS value when publishing to MQTT retain Boolean false The default retain flag when publishing to MQTT priority Integer 5 The default priority value control Boolean false Whether to publish/subscribe on the control or data topic hierarchy deviceId String empty The default device ID when publishing/subscribing to control topics The following header fields are supported. If a value is not set when publishing it is taken from the endpoint configuration: Name Type Description CamelKuraCloudService.topic String The name of the topic to publish to or from which the message was received CamelKuraCloudService.qos Integer The QoS to use when publishing to MQTT CamelKuraCloudService.retain Boolean The value of the retain flag when publishing to MQTT CamelKuraCloudService.control Boolean Whether to publish/subscribe on the control or data topic hierarchy CamelKuraCloudService.deviceId String The device ID when publishing to control topics Cloud to cloud messaging As already described, header values override the endpoint settings. This allows for a finer grained control with Camel messaging. However this can cause unexpected behavior when two Cloud API endpoints are bridged. Camel can received from a Cloud endpoint but also publish to it. Now it is possible to write Camel routes with exchange messages, receiving from one Cloud API, pushing to another. ------------------- ------------------- | Cloud Service A | <---> | Cloud Service B | ------------------- ------------------- Which could result in a Camel route XML like: <route id= \"bridgeLocalToRemote\" > <from uri= \"local-cloud:sensor/sensor1\" /> <to uri= \"upstream-cloud:gateway1/all-sensors\" /> </route> However the Consumer (from) would set the topic header value with the topic name it received the message from. And the Producer (to) would get its topic from the URI overriden by that header value.

The component is called \"Camel XML router\" and can be configured with a simple set of XML routes. The following example logs all messages received on the topic foo/bar to a logger named MESSAGE_FROM_CLOUD : <routes xmlns= \"http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring\" > <route id= \"cloudConsumer\" > <from uri= \"kura-cloud:foo/bar\" /> <to uri= \"log:MESSAGE_FROM_CLOUD\" /> </route> </routes> But it is also possible to generate data and push to upstream to the cloud service: <route id= \"route1\" > <from uri= \"timer:foo\" /> <setBody> <method ref= \"payloadFactory\" method= \"create('random',${random(10)})\" /> </setBody> <bean ref= \"payloadFactory\" method= \"append('foo','bar')\" /> <to uri= \"stream:out\" /> <to uri= \"kura-cloud:myapp/test\" /> </route> This example to run a timer named \"foo\" every second. It uses the \"Payload Factory\" bean, which is pre-registered, to create a new payload structure and then append a second element to it. The output is first sent to a logger and then to the cloud source. Defining dependencies on components It is possible to use the Web UI to define a list of Camel components which must be present in order for this configuration to work. For example if the routes make use of the \"milo-server\" adapter for providing OPC UA support then \"milo-server\" can be added and the setup will wait for this component to be registered with OSGi before the Camel context gets started. The field contains a list of comma separated component names: e.g. milo-server, timer, log Selecting a cloud service It is also possible to define a map of cloud services which will be available for upstream connectivity. This makes use of Kura's \"multi cloud client\" feature. CloudService instances will get mapped from either a Kura Service PID ( kura.service.pid , as shown in the Web UI) or a full OSGi filter. The string is a comma seperated, key=value string, where the key is the name of the Camel cloud the instance will be registered as and the value is the Kura service PID or the OSGi filter string. For example: cloud=org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService, cloud-2=foobar Custom Camel routers If a standard XML route configuration is not enough then it is possible to use XML routes in combination with a custom OSGi bundle or a Java DSL based Camel approach. For this to work a Kura development setup is required, please see Getting started for more information. The implementation of such Camel components follow the standard Kura guides for developing components, like, for example, the ConfigurableComponent pattern. This section only describes the Camel specifics. Of course it is also possible to follow a very simple approach and directly use the Camel OSGi functionalities like org.apache.camel.core.osgi.OsgiDefaultCamelContext . Note Kura currently doesn't support the OSGi Blueprint approach Kura support for Camel is split up in two layers. There is a more basic support, which helps in running a raw Camel router. This is CamelRunner which is located in the package org.eclipse.kura.camel.router . And then there are a few abstract basic components in the package org.eclipse.kura.camel.component which help in creating Kura components based on Camel. Camel components The base classes in org.eclipse.kura.camel.component are intended to help creating new OSGi DS components base on Camel. XML based component For an XML based approach which can be configured through the Kura ConfigurationService the base class AbstractXmlCamelComponent can be used. The constructor expectes the name of a property which will contain the Camel XML router information when it gets configured through the configuration service. It will automatically parse and apply the Camel routes. The method void beforeStart(CamelContext camelContext) may be used in order to configure the Camel context before it gets started. Every time the routes get updated using the modified(Map<String, Object>) method, the route XML will be re-parsed and routes will be added, removed or updated according to the new XML. Java DSL based component In order to create a Java DSL based router setup the base class AbstractJavaCamelComponent may be used, which implements and RouteBuilder class, a simple setup might look like: import org.eclipse.kura.camel.component.AbstractJavaCamelComponent ; class MyRouter extends AbstractJavaCamelComponent { public void configure () throws Exception { from ( \"direct:test\" ) . to ( \"mock:test\" ); } } Using the CamelRunner The CamelRunner class is not derived from any OSGi or Kura base class and can be used in scenarios where more flexibility is required. It allows to define a set of pre-requisites for the Camel context. It is for example possible to define a dependency on a Kura cloud service instance and a Camel component provider. Once the runner is started it will listen for OSGi services resolving those dependencies and then starting up the Camel context. The following example shows how to set up a Camel context using the CamelRunner : // create a new camel Builder Builder builder = new CamelRunner . Builder (); // add service dependency builder . cloudService ( \"kura.service.pid\" , \"my.cloud.service.pid\" ); // add Camel component dependency to 'milo-server' builder . requireComponent ( \"milo-server\" ); CamelRunner runner = builder . build (); // set routes runner . setRoutes ( new RouteBuilder () { public void configure () throws Exception { from ( \"direct:test\" ) . to ( \"mock:test\" ); } } ); // set routes runner . start (); It is also possible to later update routes with a call to setRoutes : // maybe update routes at a later time runner . setRoutes ( /* different routes */ ); Examples The following examples can help in getting started. Kura Camel example publisher The Camel example publisher ( org.eclipse.kura.example.camel.publisher ) can be used as an reference for starting. The final OSGi bundle can be dropped into a Kura application an be started. It allows to configure dynamically during runtime and is capable of switching CloudService instances dynamically. Kura Camel quickstart The Camel quickstart project ( org.eclipse.kura.example.camel.quickstart ) shows two components, Java and XML based, working together. The bundle can also be dropped into Kura for testing. Kura Camel aggregation The Camel quickstart project ( org.eclipse.kura.example.camel.aggregation ) shows a simple data aggregation pattern with Camel by processing data and publishing the result.","title":"Apache Camel&trade; as application"},{"location":"cloud-platform/apache-camel-integration/kura-camel-app/#apache-camel-as-a-kura-application","text":"As of 2.1.0 Kura provides a set of different ways to implement an application backed by Camel: Simple XML route configuration Custom XML route configuration Custom Java DSL definition","title":"Apache Camel&trade; as a Kura application"},{"location":"cloud-platform/apache-camel-integration/kura-camel-app/#kura-cloud-endpoint","text":"Kura provides a special \"Kura cloud endpoint\" which allows to publish or subscribe to the Kura Cloud API.

In both cases, the org.eclipse.kura.driver.s7plc factory must be selected and a unique name must be provided for the new instance. Channel configuration The S7 Driver channel configuration is composed of the following parameters: name : the channel name. type : the channel type, ( READ , WRITE , or READ_WRITE ). value type : the Java type of the channel value. s7.data.type : the S7 data type involved in channel operation. data.block.no : the data block number involved in channel operation. offset : the start address of the data. byte.count : the size in bytes of the transferred data. This parameter is required only if the value type parameter is set to STRING or BYTE_ARRAY . In the other cases, this parameter is ignored and the data size is automatically derived from the s7.data.type . bit.index : the index of the bit involved in channel operation inside its containing byte, index 0 is the least significant bit. This parameter is required only if the value type parameter is set to BOOLEAN and s7.data.type is set to BOOL . In the other cases, this parameter is ignored. Data Types When performing operations that deal with numeric data, two data types are involved: The Java primitive type that is used in the ChannelRecords exchanged between the driver and Java applications. (the Java type of the value received/supplied by external applications from/to the Driver in case of a read/write operation). This value type is specified by the value type configuration property. The S7 type of the data on the PLC. This value type is specified by the s7.data.type configuration property. The following S7 data types are supported: S7 Data Type Size Sign INT 16 bits signed DINT 32 bits signed WORD 16 bits unsigned DWORD 32 bits unsigned REAL 32 bits signed BOOL 1 bit n.d. BYTE 1 byte unsigned CHAR 1 byte (only supported as char arrays using the String Java data type) n.d. The Driver automatically adapts the data type used by external applications and the S7 device depending on the value of the two configuration properties mentioned above. The adaptation process involves the following steps: Each device data type is internally converted by the driver from/to a Java type large enough to represent the value of the device data without losing precision. The type mappings are the following: S7 Data Type Java Type INT int DINT int WORD int DWORD long REAL float BOOL boolean BYTE int If the value type of the channel does not match the Java type specified in mapping above, a conversion is performed by the Driver to convert it to/from the matching type, choosing appropriately between the Number.toInt() , Number.toLong() , Number.toFloat() or Number.toDouble() methods. Precision losses may occur if the Java type used by the external application is not suitable to represent all possible values of the device data type. Array Data The driver supports transferring data as raw byte arrays or ASCII strings: Byte arrays : For transferring data as byte arrays the channel value type property must be set to BYTE_ARRAY , the data.type configuration property must be set to BYTE and the byte.count property must be set to the data length in bytes.

Note about running on OpenJDK If some exceptions reporting Locked by other application are visible in the log and the driver fails to start, try switching to the Oracle JVM by installing the oracle-java8-jdk package. For more information on the problem, please see this GitHub issue. Installation As the others Drivers supported by Kura, it is distributed as a deployment package on the Eclipse Marketplace here . It can be installed following the instructions provided here . In order to use the driver, the Sensehat Support Library Bundle for Eclipse Kura needs to be installed as a prerequisite dependency. It is available from Eclipse Marketplace here . Sensors The following values of the resource parameters refer to device sensors: Resource Unit Description ACCELERATION_X , ACCELERATION_Y , ACCELERATION_Z G The proper acceleration for each axis GYROSCOPE_X , GYROSCOPE_Y , GYROSCOPE_Z rad/S The angular acceleration for each axis MAGNETOMETER_X , MAGNETOMETER_Y , MAGNETOMETERE_Z uT The magnetometer value for each axis HUMIDITY %rH The relative humidity PRESSURE mbar The pressure value TEMPERATURE_FROM_HUMIDITY \u00b0C The temperature obtained from the humidity sensor TEMPERATURE_FROM_PRESSURE \u00b0C The temperature obtained from the pressure sensor The channels referencing sensor resources can only be used for reads and only in polling mode. The driver will attempt to convert the value obtained from the sensor into the data type selected using the value.type parameter Example sensors Asset configuration: Joystick The SenseHat joystick provides four buttons: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT ENTER For each button, the driver allows to listen to the following events: PRESS : Fired once when a button is pressed RELEASE : Fired once when a button is released HOLD : Fired periodically every few seconds if the button is kept pressed The values of the resource parameter related to joystick have the following structure: JOYSTICK_{BUTTON}_{EVENT} Channels referencing joystick events must use LONG as value.type . The channel value supplied by the driver is the Java timestamp in milliseconds of the Joystick event, a value of 0 signifies that no events have been observed yet. Joystick related channels can be only used for reading and both in polling and event-driven mode. Example joystick Asset configuration: LED Matrix The driver allows accessing the SenseHat LED matrix in two ways: Using a monochrome framebuffer Using a RGB565 framebuffer Coordinates The coordinate system used by the driver defines the x coordinate as increasing along the direction identified by the joystick RIGHT button and the y coordinate increasing along the direction identified by the DOWN joystick button. Monochrome framebuffer In monochrome mode, only two colors will be used: the front color and the back color. Front and back colors Front and back colors can be configured using channels having the following values for the resource parameter: LED_MATRIX_FRONT_COLOR_R LED_MATRIX_FRONT_COLOR_G LED_MATRIX_FRONT_COLOR_B LED_MATRIX_BACK_COLOR_R LED_MATRIX_BACK_COLOR_G LED_MATRIX_BACK_COLOR_B These channel types allow to set the rgb components of the front and back color and can only be used in write mode. The supplied value must be a floating point number between 0 (led turned off) and 1 (full brightness). Note: Front and back colors are internally represented using the RGB565 format. The available colors are only the ones that can be represented using RGB565 and are supported by the device. Front and back color are retained for successive draw operations, the initial value for both colors is black (led turned off). Drawing The following resources can be used for modifying framebuffer contents: LED_MATRIX_FB_MONOCHROME : A channel of this type allows to set the framebuffer contents in monochrome mode. It can only be used in write mode and its value.type must be BYTE_ARRAY . The supplied value must be a byte array of length 64 that represent the state of the 8x8 led matrix. The offset in the array of a pixel having coordinates (x, y) is y*8 + x . The back/front color will be used for a pixel if the corresponding byte in the array is zero/non-zero. LED_MATRIX_CHARS : A channel of this type allows showing a text message using the LED matrix. It can only be used for writing and its value.type must be STRING . The characters of the message will be rendered using the front color and the background using the back color. RGB565 framebuffer The following resource allows writing the framebuffer using the RGB565 format: LED_MATRIX_FB_RGB565 : A channel of this type allows to set the framebuffer contents in RGB565 mode. It can only be used in write mode and its value.type must be BYTE_ARRAY . The supplied value must be a byte array of length 128 that represents the state of the 8x8 led matrix. Each pixel is represented by two consecutive bytes in the following way: | MSB | LSB | | RRRRRGGG | GGGBBBBB | | 15 ... 8 | 7 ... 0 | The LSB must be stored first in the array, the offset of the LSB and MSB for a pixel at coordinates (x, y) is the following: LSB : 2*(y*8 + x) MSB : 2*(y*8 + x) + 1 Mode independent resources LED_MATRIX_CLEAR : Writing anything to a LED_MATRIX_CLEAR channel will clear the framebuffer turning off all leds. LED_MATRIX_ROTATION : Allows to rotate the framebuffer of 0, 90, 180, and 170 degrees clockwise. Rotation setting will be retained for successive draw operations. The default value is 0. Writes to a LED_MATRIX_ROTATION channel can be performed using any numeric type as value.type .

Moving a pixel using the Joystick Open the Wires section of the Kura Web UI. Create an Asset that emits joystick events like the one described in the Joystick section. Only left_release , right_release , up_release and down_release channels will be used. Make sure to enable the listen flag for the channels. Create the Asset described in the LED Matrix section. Create a Script Filter and paste the code below in the script field. Connect the Joystick Asset to the input port of the Script Filter, and the output port of the Script filter to the framebuffer Asset. Open the Drivers and Assets section of the Kura Web UI, select the framebuffer Asset, click on the Data tab and select front and back colors. For example for using green as front color and red as back color, write 1 as Value for the front_g and back_r channels. You should now be able to move the green pixel with the joystick. var FB_SIZE = 8 if ( typeof ( state ) === 'undefined' ) { // framebuffer as byte array (0 -> back color, non zero -> front color) var fb = newByteArray ( FB_SIZE * FB_SIZE | 0 ) // record to be emitted for updating the fb var outRecord = newWireRecord () // property in emitted record containing fb data // change the name if needed // should match the name of a channel configured as LED_MATRIX_FB_MONOCHROME outRecord [ 'fb_mono' ] = newByteArrayValue ( fb ) state = { fb : fb , outRecord : outRecord , x : 0 , // current pixel position y : 0 , dx : 0 , // deltas to be added to pixel position dy : 0 , } } if ( typeof ( actions ) === 'undefined' ) { // associations between input property names // and position update actions, // input can be supplied using an Asset // with joystick event channels actions = { 'up_release' : function () { // decrease y coordinate state . dy = - 1 }, 'down_release' : function () { // increase y coordinate state . dy = 1 }, 'left_release' : function () { // decrease x coordinate state . dx = - 1 }, 'right_release' : function () { // increase x coordinate state . dx = 1 } } } if ( input . records . length ) { var input = input . records [ 0 ] var update = false for ( var prop in input ) { var action = actions [ prop ] // if there is an action associated with the received property, execute it if ( action ) { action () // request framebuffer update update = true } } if ( update ) { // framebuffer update requested // clear old pixel state . fb [ state . y * FB_SIZE + state . x ] = 0 // compute new pixel position state . x = ( state . x + state . dx + FB_SIZE ) % FB_SIZE state . y = ( state . y + state . dy + FB_SIZE ) % FB_SIZE // set new pixel state . fb [ state . y * FB_SIZE + state . x ] = 1 // clear deltas state . dx = 0 state . dy = 0 // emit record output . add ( state . outRecord ) } } Using RGB565 framebuffer Open the Wires section of the Kura Web UI. Create the Asset described in the LED Matrix section. Create a Script Filter and paste the code below in the script field. Create a Timer that ticks every 16 milliseconds. Connect the Timer to the input port of the Script Filter, and the output port of the Script filter to the framebuffer Asset.

Service Configuration To manage the system date and time, select the ClockService option located in the Services area as shown in the screen capture below. The ClockService provides the following configuration parameters: enabled : sets whether or not this service is enabled or disabled (Required field). clock.set.hwclock : defines if the hardware clock of the gateway must be synced after the system time is set. If enabled, the service calls the Linux command hwclock --utc --systohc . clock.provider : specifies one among Java NTP client (java-ntp), Linux chrony command (chrony-advanced), Linux ntpdate command (ntpd) (Required field). If chrony-advanced is used, Kura will not change system and/or hardware clock directly, delegating these operations to chrony. clock.ntp.host : sets a valid NTP server host address. clock.ntp.port : sets a valid NTP port number. clock.ntp.timeout : specifies the NTP timeout in milliseconds. clock.ntp.max-retry : defines the number of retries when a sync fails (retry at every minute). Subsequently, the next retry occurs on the next refresh interval. clock.ntp.retry.interval : defines the interval in seconds between each retry when a sync fails. If the clock.ntp.refresh-interval parameter is less than zero, there is no update. If the clock.ntp.refresh-interval parameter is equal to zero, there is only one try at startup (Required field). clock.ntp.refresh-interval : defines the frequency (in seconds) at which the service tries to sync the clock. Note that at the start of Kura, when the ClockService is enabled, it tries to sync the clock every minute until it is successful. After a successful sync, this operation is performed at the frequency defined by this parameter. If the value is less than zero, there is no update. If the value is equal to zero, syncs only once at startup. chrony.advanced.config : specifies the content of the chrony configuration file. If this field is left blank, the default system configuration will be used. To obtain the hardware clock synchronization the directive rtcsync could be used. The rtcsync directive provides the hardware clock synchronization made by the linux kernel every 11 minutes. For further information reference the chrony website .

If this happens and no counter action has been taken in the chrony configuration file, the risk is that the gateway will be unable to synchronise again its date and therefore will not be able to connect to the cloud and/or be fully operational. A possible way to prevent this issue is to temporary disable the certificate verification using the directive nocerttimecheck. This directory will disable the security checks of the activation and expiration times of certificates for the specified number of clock updates and should be used with caution due to the important security implications .

Currently, the only officially supported engine is Docker. Starting the Service To use this service select the ContainerOrchestrationService option located in the Services area. The ContainerOrchestrationService provides the following parameters: Enabled --activates the service when set to true Container Engine Host URL --provides a string that tells the service where to find the container engine (best left to the default value). Creating your first container. To create a container, select the + icon (Create a new component) under services . A popup dialogue box will appear. In the field Factory select org.eclipse.kura.container.provider.ContainerInstance from the drop-down. Then, using the Name field, enter the name of the container you wish to create and Finally press submit to create the component. After pressing submit, a new component will be added under the services tab, with the name that was selected in the dialogue. Select this component to finish configuring the container. Configuring the container To begin configuring the container, look under Services and select the item which has the name set in the previous step. Containers may be configured using the following fields: Enabled - When true, the service will create the defined container. When false the API will not create the container or will destroy the container if already running. Image Name - Describes the image that will be used to create the container. Remember to ensure that the selected image supports the architecture of the host machine, or else the container will not be able to start. Image Tag - Describes the version of the container image that will be used to create the container. Authentication Registry URL - URL for an alternative registry to pull images from. (If the field is left blank, credentials will be applied to Docker-Hub). Please see the Authenticated Registries document for more information about connecting to different popular registries. Authentication Username - Describes the username to access the container registry entered above. Password - Describes the password to access the alternative container registry. Image Download Retries - Describes the number of retries the framework will attempt to pull the image before giving up. Image Download Retry Interval - Describes the amount of time the framework will wait before attempting to pull the image again. Image Download Timeout - Describes the amount of time the framework will let the image download before timeout. Internal Ports - This field accepts a comma-separated list of ports that will be internally exposed on the spun-up container. External Ports - This field accepts a comma-separated list of ports that will be externally exposed on the host machine. Privileged Mode - This flag if enabled will give the container root capabilities to all devices on the host system. Please be aware that setting this flag can be dangerous, and must only be used in exceptional situations. Environment Variables (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of environment variables, which will be set inside the container when spun up. Entrypoint Override (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list which is used to override the command used to start a container. Example: ./test.sh,-v,-d,--human-readable . Memory (optional) - This field allows the configuration of the maximum amount of memory the container can use in bytes. The value is a positive integer, optionally followed by a suffix of b, k, m, g, to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes. The minimum and default values depends by the native container orchestrator. If left empty, the memory assigned to the container will be set to a default value. CPUs (optional) - This value specifies how many CPUs a container can use. Decimal values are allowed, so if set to 1.5, the container will use at most one and a half cpu resource. GPUs (optional) - This field configures how many Nvidia GPUs a container can use. Allowed values are 'all' or an integer number. If there's no Nvidia GPU installed, leave it empty. The Nvidia Container Toolkit must be installed on the system to correctly configure the service, otherwise the container will not start. Volume Mount (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of system-to-container file mounts. This allows for the container to access files on the host machine. Peripheral Device (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of device paths. This parameter allows devices to be passed through from the host to the container. Networking Mode (optional) - Use this field to specify what networking mode the container will use. Possible Drivers include: bridge, none, container:{container id}, host. Please note that this field is case-sensitive. This field can also be used to connect to any of the networks listed by the cli command docker network ls . Logger Type - This field provides a drop-down selection of supported container logging drivers. Logger Parameters (optional) - This field accepts a comma-separated list of logging parameters. More information can be found in the container-engine logger documentation, for instance here . After specifying container parameters, ensure to set Enabled to true and press Apply . The container engine will then pull the respective image, spin up and start the container. If the gateway or the framework is power cycled, and the container and Container Orchestration Service are set to enabled , the framework will automatically start the container again upon startup. Stopping the container Warning Stopping a container will delete it in an irreversible way. Please be sure to only use stateless containers and/or save their data in external volumes. To stop the container without deleting the component, set the Enabled field to false , and then press Apply . This will delete the running container, but leave this component available for running the container again in the future. If you want to completely remove the container and component, press the Delete button to the top right of the screen, and press Yes on the confirmation dialogue. Container Management Dashboard The Container Orchestration service also provides the user with an intuitive container dashboard. This dashboard shows all containers running on a gateway, including containers created with the framework and those created manually through the command-line interface.

The main features of this SQL Database are: Very fast, open source, JDBC API Embedded and server modes; in-memory databases Browser-based Console application Small footprint Supported Features Kura supports the following H2 database features: Persistence modes : The H2 implementation currently supports in-memory and file-based database instances. See the Persistence Modes section for more details. Multiple database instances : It is possible to create and configure multiple database instances from the Kura Administration UI, these instances can be selectively consumed by applications. A default database instance is created automatically. TCP Server : The current implementation allows external processes to access the database instances managed by Kura using TCP. This enables the integration of external applications that can share data with Kura components using the database. Web-based console : It is possible to start the H2 Web console directly from the Kura Administration UI. The console can be used to inspect the database contents and perform arbitrary queries for debug purposes. Basic credential management : The current implementation allows to change the password of the admin DB user from the Kura Administration UI. This allows the access restriction to the existing database instances. By default, the DataService in Kura uses the H2 database to persist the messages. Limitations Private in-memory instances : Only named in-memory instances are supported (e.g. jdbc:h2:mem:<dbname> , where <dbname> is not the empty string), private instances represented by the jdbc:h2:mem: URL are currently not supported. Remote connections : The current implementation only supports embedded database instances. Connecting to remote instances using the jdbc:h2:tcp:* and jdbc:h2:ssl:* connector URLs is not supported. Note The new DbWireRecordFilter and DbWireRecordStore Wire components have been added. These components provide the same functionalities offered by the old H2DbWireRecordFilter and H2DbWireRecordStore components, but they can be used for connectiong to a generic relational database (i.e. H2DB, MySQL or MariaDB). The legacy components will continue to be available in order to keep backward compatibility, but will be deprecated since Kura 5.2.0 and should not be used for new installations. Usage Creating a new H2 database instance To create a new H2 database instance, use the following procedure: Open the Administrative UI and press the + button in the side menu, under the Services section. A pop-up dialog should appear. Select org.eclipse.kura.core.db.H2DbService from the Factory drop-down list, enter an arbitrary name for the new instance and click Apply . An entry for the newly created instance should appear in the side menu under Services , click on it to review its configuration. It is not possible to create different DB instances that manage the same DB URL. When creating a new instance please make sure that the URL specified in the field db.connector.url is not managed by another instance. Selecting a database instance for existing components A database instance is identified by its Kura service PID . The PID for the default instance is org.eclipse.kura.db.H2DbService while the PID for instances created using the Web UI is the string entered in the Name field at step 2 of the previous section. The built-in components that use database functionalities allow to specify which instance to use in their configuration. These components are the DataService component of the cloud stack, the DbWireRecordFilter and DbWireRecordStore wire components. The configuration of each component contains a property that allows to specify the service PID of the desired instance. Enabling the TCP Server Danger This feature is intended to be used only for debugging/development purposes . The server created by H2 is not running on a secure protocol . Only enable the server for a limited time and make sure to properly secure the firewall ports on which it is running. The TCP server can be used by creating a H2DbServer instance: Open the Web UI and press the + button in the side menu, under the Services section. A pop-up dialog should appear. Select org.eclipse.kura.core.db.H2DbServer from the Factory drop-down\u200b list, enter an arbitrary name for the new instance and click Apply. Clicking on the name of the new server instance on the left side of the Web UI\u200b. The configuration of the server component will appear. Set the db.server.type field to TCP . Review the server options under db.server.commandline , check the official documentation for more information about the available options. Set the db.server.enabled to true . The server, with the default configuration, will be listening on port 9123. Tip Make sure to review the firewall configuration in order to ensure that the server is reachable from an external process. Enabling the Web Console Danger This feature is intended to be used only for debugging/development purposes . The server created by H2 is not running on a secure protocol . Only enable the server for a limited time and make sure to properly secure the firewall ports on which it is running. In order to enable the H2 Web console, proceed as follows: 1. Create a new H2DbServer instance. 2. Set the db.server.type field to WEB . 3. Enter appropriate parameters for the Web server in the db.server.commandline field. An example of valid settings can be -webPort 9123 -webAllowOthers -ifExists -webExternalNames <device-ip> . 4. Set the db.server.enabled to true . The server is now listening on the specified port. Tip Make sure to review the firewall configuration in order to ensure that the server is reachable from an external process. Use a browser to access the console. Open the http:// : URL, where is the IP address of the gateway and is the port specified at step 3. Enter the DB URL as specified in the Kura configuration in the JDBC URL field and the credentials. Click on Connect , you should be able to access the console. Change the Database Password To change the database password the System Administrator needs to: Open the configuration of the desired database instance in the Web UI. Enter the new password in the db.password field. Click Apply . Warn If the H2DbServer instance fails to open a database, it will delete and recreate all database files. This behavior\u200b is aimed at preventing potential issues caused by incorrect credentials in the configuration snapshots. It is highly recommended to perform a backup of an existing database before trying to open it using a H2DbService instance and before changing the password. Persistence Modes The H2 database supports several persistence modes. In Memory An in-memory database instance can be created using the following URL structure: jdbc:h2:mem: , where is a non-empty string that represents the database name. This configuration is suggested for database instances that are frequently updated. Examples: jdbc:h2:mem:kuradb jdbc:h2:mem:mydb The default database instance is in-memory by default and uses the jdbc:h2:mem:kuradb URL. Persistent A persistent database instance can be created using the jdbc:h2:file: , where is a non-empty string that represents the database path. If no URL parameters are supplied the database will enable the transaction log by default. The transaction log is used to restore the database to a consistent state after a crash or power failure. This provides good protection against data losses but causes a lot of writes to the storage device, reducing both performance and the lifetime of flash-based storage devices. Examples: - jdbc:h2:file:/opt/db/mydb Make sure to use absolute paths in the DB URL since H2 does not support DB paths relative to the working directory.","title":"H2Db Service"},{"location":"core-services/h2db-service/#h2db-service","text":"Kura integrates a Java SQL database named H2 .

It supports all major frameworks like TensorFlow, TensorRT, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and even custom framework backend. With specific backends, it is also possible to run Python scripts, mainly for pre-and post-processing purposes, and exploit the DALI building block for optimized operations. For more detail about the Triton Server, please refer to the official website . Kura provides three components for exposing the Triton Server service functionality which implement the inference engine APIs and provides methods for interacting with a local or remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server: TritonServerRemoteService : provides methods for interacting with a remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server without managing the server lifecycle. Can be used both for connecting to a remote instance or a local non-managed instance. It exposes a simpler but more limited configuration. TritonServerNativeService : provides methods for interacting with a local native Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. Requires the Triton Server executable to be already available on the device and offers more options and features (like AI Model Encryption). TritonServerContainerService : provides methods for interacting with a local container running Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. Requires the Triton Server container image to be already available on the device and offers more options and features (like AI Model Encryption). TritonServerService : provides methods for interacting with a local or remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server within the same component. Note : deprecated since 5.2.0 Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server installation Before running Kura's Triton Server Service, you must install the Triton Inference Server. Here you can find the necessary steps for the available suggested installation methods. Native Triton installation on Jetson devices A release of Triton for JetPack is provided in the tar file in the Triton Inference Server release notes . Full documentation is available here . Installation steps: Before running the executable you need to install the Runtime Dependencies for Triton . After doing so you can extract the tar file and run the executable in the bin folder. It is highly recommended to add the tritonserver executable to your path or symlinking the executable to /usr/local/bin . Triton Docker image installation Before you can use the Triton Docker image you must install Docker . If you plan on using a GPU for inference you must also install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit . Pull the image using the following command. $ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3 Where <xx.yy> is the version of Triton that you want to pull. Native Triton installation on supported devices The official docs mention the possibility to perform a native installation on supported platform by extracting the binaries from the Docker images. To do so you must install the necessary dependencies (some can be found in the Jetson runtime dependencies docs ) on the system. For Triton to support NVIDIA GPUs you must install CUDA, cuBLAS and cuDNN referencing the support matrix . Note For Python models the libraries available to the Python model are the ones available for the user running the Triton server. Therefore you'll need to install the libraries through pip for the kurad user. Triton Server setup The Triton Inference Server serves models from one or more model repositories that are specified when the server is started. The model repository is the directory where you place the models that you want Triton to serve. Be sure to follow the instructions to setup the model repository directory. Further information about an example Triton Server setup can be found in the official documentation . Triton Server Remote Service component The Kura Triton Server Remote Service component is the implementation of the inference engine APIs and provides methods for interacting with a remote (i.e. unmnanaged) Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. As presented below, the component enables the user to communicate to an external server to load specific models. With this component the server lifecycle (startup, shutdown) won't be handled by Kura and it's the user responsibility to make it available to Kura for connecting. The parameters used to configure the Triton Service are the following: Nvidia Triton Server address : the address of the Nvidia Triton Server. Nvidia Triton Server ports : the ports used to connect to the server for HTTP, GRPC, and Metrics services. Inference Models : a comma-separated list of inference model names that the server will load. The models have to be already present in the filesystem where the server is running. This option simply tells the server to load the given models from a local or remote repository. Timeout (in seconds) for time consuming tasks : Timeout (in seconds) for time consuming tasks like server startup, shutdown or model load.

Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] The Kura Triton Server component is the implementation of the inference engine APIs and provides methods for interacting with a local or remote Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server. As presented below, the component enables the user to configure a local server running on the gateway or to communicate to an external server to load specific models. The parameters used to configure the Triton Service are the following: Local Nvidia Triton Server : If enabled, a local native Nvidia Triton Server is started on the gateway. In this case, the model repository and backends path are mandatory. Moreover, the server address property is overridden and set to localhost. Be aware that the Triton Server has to be already installed on the system. Nvidia Triton Server address : the address of the Nvidia Triton Server. Nvidia Triton Server ports : the ports used to connect to the server for HTTP, GRPC, and Metrics services. Local model repository path : Only for a local instance, specify the path on the filesystem where the models are stored. Local model decryption password : Only for local instance, specify the password to be used for decrypting models stored in the model repository. If none is specified, models are supposed to be plaintext. Inference Models : a comma-separated list of inference model names that the server will load.

The default ports are the 8000-8002, but these are tipically used by Kura for debug purposes. Configuration for a local native Triton Server with Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] Note Requirement : tritonserver executable needs to be available in the path to the kurad user. Be sure to have a working Triton Server installation before configuring the local native Triton Server instance through Kura UI. When the Local Nvidia Triton Server option is set to true, a local instance of the Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is started on the gateway. The following configuration is required: Local Nvidia Triton Server : true Nvidia Triton Server address : localhost Nvidia Triton Server ports : mandatory Local model repository path : mandatory Inference Models : mandatory. Note that the models have to be already present on the filesystem. Local backends path : mandatory The typical command used to start the Triton Server is like this: tritonserver --model-repository = <model_repository_path> \\ --backend-directory = <backend_repository_path> \\ --backend-config = <backend_config> \\ --http-port = <http_port> \\ --grpc-port = <grpc_port> \\ --metrics-port = <metrics_port> \\ --model-control-mode = explicit \\ --load-model = <model_name_1> \\ --load-model = <model_name_2> \\ ... Configuration for a local Triton Server running in a Docker container with Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] If the Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is running as a Docker container in the gateway, the following configuration is required: Local Nvidia Triton Server : false Nvidia Triton Server address : localhost Nvidia Triton Server ports : \\<mandatory> Inference Models : \\<mandatory>. The models have to be already present on the filesystem. In order to correctly load the models at runtime, configure the server with the --model-control-mode=explicit option. The typical command used for running the docker container is as follows. Note the forward of the ports to not interfere with Kura. docker run --rm \\ -p4000:8000 \\ -p4001:8001 \\ -p4002:8002 \\ --shm-size = 150m \\ -v path/to/models:/models \\ nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver: [ version ] \\ tritonserver --model-repository = /models --model-control-mode = explicit Configuration for a remote Triton Server with Triton Server Service component [deprecated since 5.2.0] When the Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is running on a remote server, the following configuration is needed: Local Nvidia Triton Server : false Nvidia Triton Server address : mandatory Nvidia Triton Server ports : mandatory Inference Models : mandatory. The models have to be already present on the filesystem. AI Model Encryption Support For ensuring inference integrity and providing copyright protection of deep-learning models on edge devices, Kura provides decryption capabilities for trained models to be served through the Triton Server. How it works Prerequisites : a deep-learning trained model (or more) exists with the corresponding necessary configuration for running on the Triton Server without encryption. A folder containing the required files (model, configuration etc) has been tested on a Triton Server. Restrictions : if model encryption is used, the following restrictions apply: model encryption support is only available for a local Triton Server instance all models in the folder containing the encrypted models must be encrypted all models must be encrypted with OpenPGP-compliant AES 256 cipher algorithm all models must be encrypted with the same password Once the development of the deep-learning model is complete, the developer who wants to deploy the model on the edge device in a secure manner can proceed with encrypting the Triton model using the procedure detailed below. After encrypting the model he/she can transfer the file on the edge device using his/her preferred method. Kura will keep the stored model protected at all times and have the model decrypted in runtime only for use by the Inference Server Runtime. As soon as the model is correctly loaded into memory the decrypted model will be removed from the filesystem. As an additional security measure, the Model Repository containing the decrypted models will be stored in a temporary subfolder and will feature restrictive permission such that only Kura, the Inference Server and the root user will be able to access it. Encryption procedure Given a trained model inside the folder tf_autoencoder_fp32 (for example) with the following layout (see the official documentation for details): tf_autoencoder_fp32 \u251c\u2500\u2500 1 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 model.savedmodel \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 keras_metadata.pb \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 saved_model.pb \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 variables \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 variables.data-00000-of-00001 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 variables.index \u2514\u2500\u2500 config.pbtxt Compress the model into a zip archive with the following command: zip -vr tf_autoencoder_fp32.zip tf_autoencoder_fp32/ then encrypt it with the AES 256 algorithm using the following gpg command: gpg --armor --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 tf_autoencoder_fp32.zip The resulting archive tf_autoencoder_fp32.zip.asc can be transferred to the Local Model Repository Path on the target machine and will be decrypted by Kura.","title":"Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server Inference Engine"},{"location":"core-services/nvidia-triton-server-inference-engine/#nvidiatm-triton-server-inference-engine","text":"The Nvidia\u2122 Triton Server is an open-source inference service software that enables the user to deploy trained AI models from any framework on GPU or CPU infrastructure.

This 'fake' interface name is replaced by 'proper' interface name (e.g., ppp0) when the first modem configuration is submitted. The cellular interface should be configured by first enabling it in the TCP/IP tab, and then setting the Cellular tab. Note that the cellular interface can only be set as WAN using DHCP . The cellular interface configuration options are described below. Cellular Configuration The Cellular tab contains the following configuration parameters: Model : specifies the modem model. Network Technology : describes the network technology used by this modem. HSDPA EVDO Modem Identifier : provides a unique name for this modem. Interface # : provides a unique number for the modem interface (e.g., an interface # of 0 would name the modem interface ppp0). Dial String : instructs how the modem should attempt to connect. Typical dial strings are as follows: HSPA modem: atd*99***1# EVDO/CDMA modem: atd#777 APN : defines the modem access point name (HSPA modems only). Auth Type : specifies the authentication type (HSPA modems only). None Auto CHAP PAP Username : supplies the username; disabled if no authentication method is specified. Password : supplies the password; disabled if no authentication method is specified. Modem Reset Timeout : sets the modem reset timeout in minutes. If set to a non-zero value, the modem is reset after n consecutive minutes of unsuccessful connection attempts. If set to zero, the modem keeps trying to establish a PPP connection without resetting. The default value is 5 minutes. Reopen Connection on Termination : sets the persist option of the PPP daemon that specifies if PPP daemon should exit after connection is terminated. Note that the maxfail option still has an effect on persistent connections. Connection Attempts : sets the maxfail option of the PPP daemon that limits the number of consecutive failed PPP connection attempts. The default value is 5 connection attempts. A value of zero means no limit. The PPP daemon terminates after the specified number of failed PPP connection attempts and restarts by the ModemMonitor thread. Disconnect if Idle : sets the idle option of the PPP daemon, which terminates the PPP connection if the link is idle for a specified number of seconds. The default value is 95 seconds. To disable this option, set it to zero. Active Filter : sets the active-filter option of the PPP daemon. This option specifies a packet filter (filter-expression) to be applied to data packets in order to determine which packets are regarded as link activity, and thereby, reset the idle timer. The filter-expression syntax is as described for tcpdump(1); however, qualifiers that do not apply to a PPP link, such as ether and arp , are not permitted. The default value is inbound . To disable the active-filter option, leave it blank. LCP Echo Interval : sets the lcp-echo-interval option of the PPP daemon. If set to a positive number, the modem sends LCP echo request to the peer at the specified number of seconds. To disable this option, set it to zero. This option may be used with the lcp-echo-failure option to detect that the peer is no longer connected. LCP Echo Failure : sets the lcp-echo-failure option of the PPP daemon. If set to a positive number, the modem presumes the peer to be dead if a specified number of LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply. To disable this option, set it to zero. Enable GPS : enables GPS with the following conditions: One modem port will be dedicated to NMEA data stream. This port may not be used to send AT commands to the modem. PositionService should be enabled. Serial settings of PositionService should not be changed; it will be redirected to the modem GPS port automatically. Cellular Linux Configuration This section describes the changes applied by Kura at the Linux networking configuration. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state.

The DataService delegates to the MqttDataTransport service the implementation of the transport protocol that is used to interact with the remote server. The DataService also adds the capability of storing published messages in a persistent store function and sending them over the wire at a later time. The purpose of this feature is to relieve service users from implementing their own persistent store. Service users may publish messages independently on the DataService connection status. In order to overcome the potential latencies introduced by buffering messages, the DataService allows a priority level to be assigned to\u200b each published message. Depending on the store configuration, there are certain guarantees that stored messages are not lost due to sudden crashes or power outages. To use this service, select the DataService option located in the Cloud Connections area as shown in the screen capture below. The DataService offers methods and configuration options to manage the connection to the remote server including the following (all required) parameters described below. connect.auto-on-startup : when set to true, the service tries to auto-connect to the remote server on start-up and restore the connection every time the device is disconnected. These attempts are made at the frequency defined in the connect.retry-interval parameter until the connection is established. connect.retry-interval : specifies the connection retry frequency after a disconnection. enable.recovery.on.connection.failure : when enabled, activates the recovery feature on connection failure: if the device is not able to connect to a remote cloud platform, the service will wait for a specified amount of connection retries. If the recovery fails, the device will be rebooted. Being based on the Watchdog service, it needs to be activated as well. connection.recovery.max.failures : related to the previous parameter.

Additionally, Kura provides the ability to manage network access security to an IoT Gateway through the following: Open Ports (local service rules) Port Forwarding IP Forwarding and Masquerading (NAT service rules) 'Automatic' NAT service rules Open Ports, Port Forwarding, and IP Forwarding and Masquerading are configured via respective Firewall configuration tabs. 'Automatic' NAT is enabled for each local (LAN) interface using the DHCP & NAT tab of the respective interface configuration. Firewall Linux Configuration This section describes the changes applied by Kura at the Linux networking configuration. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state. When a new firewall configuration is submitted, Kura immediately applies it using the iptables service provided by the OS. Moreover, the rules are stored in the filesystem and a new Kura snapshot is generated containing the new configuration. At the next startup, the firewall service in the OS will re-apply them and Kura will check the firewall configuration against the one contained in the last snapshot. In this way, the user can update the snapshot with the needed rules and apply them to the system using the webUI or modify the snapshot_0.xml before the first start of Kura. In order to allow a better coexistence between Kura and external applications that need to modify firewall rules, Kura writes its rules to a set of custom iptables chains. They are input-kura , output-kura , forward-kura , forward-kura-pf and forward-kura-ipf for the filter table and input-kura , output-kura , prerouting-kura , prerouting-kura-pf , postrouting-kura , postrouting-kura-pf and postrouting-kura-ipf for the nat table. The custom chains are then put in their respective standard iptables chains, as shown in the following: iptables -t filter -I INPUT -j input-kura iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -j output-kura iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -j forward-kura iptables -t filter -I forward-kura -j forward-kura-pf iptables -t filter -I forward-kura -j forward-kura-ipf iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -j prerouting-kura iptables -t nat -I prerouting-kura -j prerouting-kura-pf iptables -t nat -I INPUT -j input-kura iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -j output-kura iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -j postrouting-kura iptables -t nat -I postrouting-kura -j postrouting-kura-pf iptables -t nat -I postrouting-kura -j postrouting-kura-ipf Even if many firewall rules can be handled by Kura, it could be that some rules cannot be filled through the Web Console. In this case, custom firewall rules may be added to the /etc/init.d/firewall_cust script manually. These rules are applied/reapplied every time the firewall service starts, that is at the gateway startup. These custom rules should not be applied to the Kura custom chains, but to the standard ones. Open Ports If Kura is running on a gateway, all TCP/UDP ports are closed by default unless they are listed in the Open Ports tab of the Firewall section in the Gateway Administration Console, or in the /etc/sysconfig/iptables script. Therefore, if a user needs to connect to a specific port on a gateway, it is insufficient to have an application listening on the desired port; the port also needs to be opened in the firewall. To open a port using the Gateway Administration Console, select the Firewall option located in the System area. The Firewall configuration display appears in the main window. With the Open Ports tab selected, click the New button. The New Open Port Entry form appears. The New Open Port Entry form contains the following configuration parameters: Port : specifies the port to be opened. (Required field.) Protocol : defines the protocol (tcp or udp). (Required field.) Permitted Network : only allows packets originated by a host on this network. Permitted Interface Name : only allows packets arrived on this interface. Unpermitted Interface Name : blocks packets arrived on this interface. Permitted MAC Address : only allows packets originated by this host. Source Port Range : only allows packets with source port in the defined range. Complete the New Open Port Entry form and click the Submit button when finished. Once the form is submitted, a new port entry will appear. Click the Apply button for the change to take effect. The firewall rules related to the open ports section are stored in the input-kura custom chain of the filter table. Port Forwarding Port forwarding rules are needed to establish connectivity from the WAN side to a specific port on a host that resides on a LAN behind the gateway. In this case, a routing solution may be avoided since the connection is made to a specified external port on a gateway, and packets are forwarded to an internal port on the destination host; therefore, it is not necessary to add the external port to the list of open ports. To add a port forwarding rule, select the Port Forwarding tab on the Firewall display and click the New button. The Port Forward Entry form appears. The Port Forward Entry form contains the following configuration parameters: Input Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be received. (Required field). Output Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be forwarded to its destination. (Required field). LAN Address : supplies the IP address of destination host. (Required field). Protocol : defines the protocol (tcp or udp). (Required field). External Port : provides the external destination port on gateway unit. (Required field). Internal Port : provides the port on a destination host. (Required field). Enable Masquerading : defines whether masquerading is used (yes or no). If enabled, the gateway replaces the IP address of the originating host with the IP address of its own output (LAN) interface. This is needed when the destination host does not have a back route to the originating host (or default gateway route) via the gateway unit. The masquerading option is provided with port forwarding to limit gateway forwarding only to the destination port. (Required field). Permitted Network : only forwards if the packet is originated from a host on this network. Permitted MAC Address : only forwards if the packet is originated by this host. Source Port Range : only forwards if the packet's source port is within the defined range. Complete the Port Forward Entry form and click the Apply button for the desired port forwarding rules to take effect. The firewall rules related to the port forwarding section are stored in the forward-kura-pf custom chain of the filter table and in the postrouting-kura-pf and prerouting-kura-pf chains of the nat table. Port Forwarding example This section describes an example of port forwarding rules. The initial setup is described below. A couple of RaspberryPi that shares the same LAN over Ethernet. The first RaspberryPi running Kura is configured as follows: The eth0 interface static with IP address of 172.16.0.5. There is no default gateway. The second RaspberryPi running Kura is configured as follows: The eth0 interface LAN/static with IP address of 172.16.0.1/24 and no NAT. The wlan0 interface is WAN/DHCP client. A laptop is connected to the same network of the wlan0 of the second RaspberryPi and can ping its wlan0 interface. The purpose of the second RaspberryPi configuration is to enable access to the Administration Console running on the first one (port 80) by connecting to the second RaspberryPi's port 8080 over the wlan. This scenario assumes that IP addresses are assigned as follows: Second RaspberryPi wlan0 - 10.200.12.6 Laptop wlan0 - 10.200.12.10 The following port forwarding entries are added to the second RaspberryPi configuration as described above using the Port Forward Entry form: Input Interface - wlan0 Output Interface - eth0 LAN Address - 172.16.0.5 Protocol - tcp External Port - 8080 Internal Port - 80 Masquerade - yes The Permitted Network , Permitted MAC Address , and Source Port Range fields are left blank. The following iptables rules are applied and added to the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file: iptables -t nat -A prerouting-kura-pf -i wlan0 -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to 172 .16.0.5:80 iptables -t nat -A postrouting-kura-pf -o eth0 -p tcp -d 172 .16.0.5 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A forward-kura-pf -i wlan0 -o eth0 -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 --dport 80 -d 172 .16.0.5 -j ACCEPT iptables -A forward-kura-pf -i eth0 -o wlan0 -p tcp -s 172 .16.0.5 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT The following iptables commands may be used to verify that the new rules have been applied: sudo iptables -v -n -L sudo iptables -v -n -L -t nat At this point, it is possible to try to connect to http://10.200.12.6 and to http://10.200.12.6:8080 from the laptop. Note that when a connection is made to the device on port 80, it is to the Kura configuration page on the device itself (the second RaspberryPi). When the gateway is connected on port 8080, you are forwarded to the Kura Gateway Administration Console on the first RaspberryPi. The destination host can only be reached by connecting to the gateway on port 8080. Another way to connect to the Kura Gateway Administration Console on the first RaspberryPi would be to add an IP Forwarding/Masquerading entry as described in the next section. IP Forwarding/Masquerading The advantage of the Automatic NAT method is its simplicity. However, this approach does not handle reverse NATing, and it cannot be used for interfaces that are not listed in the Gateway Administration Console (such as VPN tun0 interface). To set up generic (one-to-many) NATing, select the IP Forwarding/Masquerading tab on the Firewall display. The IP Forwarding/Masquerading form appears. The IP Forwarding/Masquerading form contains the following configuration parameters: Input Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be received. (Required field). Output Interface : specifies the interface through which a packet is going to be forwarded to its destination. (Required field). Protocol : defines the protocol of the rule to check (all, tcp, or udp). (Required field). Source Network/Host : identifies the source network or host name (CIDR notation). Set to 0.0.0.0/0 if empty. Destination Network/Host : identifies the destination network or host name (CIDR notation). Set to 0.0.0.0/0 if empty. Enable Masquerading : defines whether masquerading is used (yes or no). If set to 'yes', masquerading is enabled. If set to 'no', only FORWARDING rules are be added. (Required field). The rules will be added to the forward-kura-ipf chain in the filter table and in the postrouting-kura-ipf one in the nat table. As a use-case scenario, consider the same setup as in port forwarding, but with cellular interface disabled and eth1 interface configured as WAN/DHCP client. In this case, the interfaces of the gateway are configured as follows: eth0 : LAN/Static/No NAT 172.16.0.1/24 eth1 : WAN/DHCP 10.11.5.4/24 To reach the gateway sitting on the 172.16.0.5/24 from a specific host on the 10.11.0.0/16 network, set up the following Reverse NAT entry: Input Interface: eth1 (WAN interface) Output Interface: eth0 (LAN interface) Protocol: all Source Network/Host: 10.11.5.21/32 Destination Network/Host: 172.16.0.5/32 Enable Masquerading: yes This case applies the following iptables rules: iptables -t nat -A postrouting-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 10 .11.5.21/32 -d 172 .16.0.5/32 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 172 .16.0.5/32 -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 10 .11.5.21/32 -d 172 .16.0.5/32 -i eth1 -o eth0 -m tcp -j ACCEPT Additionally, a route to the 172.16.0.0/24 network needs to be configured on a connecting laptop as shown below: sudo route add -net 172 .16.0.0 netmask 255 .255.255.0 gw 10 .11.5.4 Since masquerading is enabled, there is no need to specify the back route on the destination host. Note that with this setup, the gateway only forwards packets originating on the 10.11.5.21 laptop to the 172.16.0.5 destination. If the Source Network/Host and Destination Network/Host fields are empty, iptables rules appear as follows: iptables -t nat -A postrouting-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 -d 0 .0.0.0/0 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A forward-kura-ipf -p tcp -s 0 .0.0.0/0 -d 0 .0.0.0/0 -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT The gateway forwards packets from any external host (connected to eth1) to any destination on the local network (eth0 interface).","title":"Firewall Configuration"},{"location":"gateway-configuration/firewall-configuration/#firewall-configuration","text":"Kura offers easy management of the Linux firewall iptables included in an IoT Gateway.

Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state. When a new firewall configuration is submitted, Kura immediately applies it using the iptables service provided by the OS. Moreover, the rules are stored in the filesystem and a new Kura snapshot is generated containing the new configuration. At the next startup, the firewall service in the OS will re-apply them and Kura will check the firewall configuration against the one contained in the last snapshot. In this way, the user can update the snapshot with the needed rules and apply them to the system using the webUI or modify the snapshot_0.xml before the first start of Kura. In order to allow a better coexistence between Kura and external applications that need to modify firewall rules, Kura writes its rules to a set of custom iptables chains. They are input-kura , output-kura , forward-kura , forward-kura-pf and forward-kura-ipf for the filter table and input-kura , output-kura , prerouting-kura , prerouting-kura-pf , postrouting-kura , postrouting-kura-pf and postrouting-kura-ipf for the nat table.

In this case, custom firewall rules may be added to the /etc/init.d/firewall_cust script manually.

The Kura Gateway Administration Console enables you to monitor the gateway status, manage the network configuration, and manage the installed application and services. Access to the Kura Gateway Administration Console requires that a unit running Eclipse Kura is reachable via its Ethernet primary interface. Connections on HTTP port 443 for these interfaces are allowed by default through the built-in firewall. The Kura Gateway Administration Console can be accessed by typing the IP address of the gateway into the browser's URL bar. Once the URL is submitted, the user is required to log in and is then redirected to the Administration Console (e.g., https://192.168.2.8/admin/console ) shown in the screen capture below. The default login name and password is admin/admin . Warning It is recommended to change the default password after initial setup and before deployment, as well as limiting access to the Administration Console to a trusted local network interface using appropriate firewall rules. Password change Once logged in, the user can modify its password (recommended after the first login). To access the option, click on the button near the username in the header section. A dropdown menu appears with the logout and the password modification options. When clicking on \"Change password\", the following dialog will appear: After confirming the changes, the user will be logged out. Accessing the Kura Gateway Administration Console over a Cellular Link In order to connect to the Gateway Administration Console via a cellular interface, the following requirements must be met: The service plan must allow for a static, public IP address to be assigned to the cellular interface. The used ports must not be blocked by the provider. The user must add Open Port entries for the cellular interface. This may be done either through the Firewall tab. If some of the used ports are blocked by the service provider, there is an option to reconfigure the gateway to use another port (i.e., 8080). In order to do so, the following requirements must be met: The HttpService configuration must be changed to use the new ports. The new ports must be open in the firewall for all network interfaces. HTTPS related warnings Most browsers will probably warn the user that the connection is not secure when Gateway Administration Console is accessed using HTTPS. In order to remove the warning, the browser must be able to verify the identity of the gateway as an HTTPS server.

Tip It is recommended that the TCP/IP tab is configured first since it defines how the interface is going to be used. TCP/IP Configuration The TCP/IP tab contains the following configuration parameters: Status Disabled: disables the selected interface (i.e., administratively down). Enabled for LAN: designates the interface for a local network. It can be set as a DHCP server for hosts on the local network and can serve as a default gateway for those hosts; however, it cannot be set as an actual gateway interface for this device. That is, packets must be routed from this interface to another interface that is configured as WAN. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Enabled for WAN: designates the interface as a gateway to an external network. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Not Managed: the interface will be ignored by Kura. Layer 2 Only: only the Layer 2 portion of the interface will be configured. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Configure Manually: allows manual entry of the IP Address and Netmask fields, if the interface is configured as LAN; allows manual entry of the IP Address , Netmask , Gateway , and DNS Servers fields, if the interface is designated as WAN. Using DHCP: configures the interface as a DHCP client obtaining the IP address from a network DHCP server. IP Address - defines the IP address of the interface, if manually configured. Subnet Mask - defines the subnet mask of the interface, if manually configured. Gateway - specifies the default gateway for the unit. (Required field if the interface is designated as WAN and manually configured.) DNS Servers - provides a list of DNS servers, if the interface is designated as WAN and is manually configured. Search Domains - Not implemented. If the network interface is Enabled for LAN and manually configured (i.e., not a DHCP client), the DHCP & NAT tab allows the DHCP server to be configured and/or NAT (IP forwarding with masquerading) to be enabled. DHCP & NAT Configuration The DHCP & NAT tab contains the following configuration parameters: Router Mode DHCP and NAT: indicates that both DHCP server and NAT are enabled. DHCP Only: indicates that DHCP server is enabled and NAT is disabled. NAT Only: indicates that NAT is enabled and DHCP server is disabled. Off: indicates that both DHCP server and NAT are disabled. DHCP Beginning Address : specifies the first address of DHCP pool (i.e., first available client IP address). DHCP Ending Address : specifies the last address of DHCP pool (i.e., last IP address that can be assigned to a client). DHCP Subnet Mask : defines the subnet mask that is assigned to a client. DHCP Default Lease Time : sets the default time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. DHCP Max Lease Time : sets the maximum time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. Pass DNS Servers through DHCP : enables DNS Proxy (i.e., passing DNS servers through DHCP). If NAT is enabled and there is another interface designated as WAN (e.g., ppp0), the following iptables rules are added to the custom automatic NAT service rules _* section of the /etc/init.d/firewall script: # custom automatic NAT service rules (if NAT option is enabled for LAN interface) iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o ppp0 -j ACCEPT Also, IP forwarding is enabled in the kernel as follows: # allow fowarding if any masquerade is defined echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward The rules shown above create an Overloaded _ (i.e., many-to-one) NAT. This type of network address translation maps multiple IP addresses on the LAN side to a single IP address on the WAN side, allowing internet access from hosts on a local network via a gateway (WAN) interface. Note that for NAT rules to be added, it is insufficient to enable NATing through the DHCP & NAT * tab of the LAN interface; there must also be another interface designated as WAN. Network Linux Configuration When applying a new network configuration, Kura changes the configuration files of the Linux networking subsystem. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state.

The snippets can be modified adapting them to the required configuration (i.e. changing the interface name in the property to be applied). Warning Be aware that an inconsitent or wrong configuration can compromise the network functionality of the gateway. Try the new configuration on a test device before appling it in a production environment! Moreover, if a property is not present in the new snapshot, the old value is used for the configuration. So, the best practice is to set all the needed properties in the snapshot.

With this option selected, the Network display appears with a list of available interfaces. Configuration tabs for the selected interface appear on the right side of the screen. By default, the loopback (lo) interface is selected when the network interfaces are displayed. Choose the desired network interface (e.g., eth0, eth1, wlan0, ppp0) and apply the necessary configuration changes using the tabs on the right. Submit the modified configuration by clicking the Apply button. In case of typing errors, the Reset button can be used to reload the prior configuration on the screen. Since the network configuration shown on the screen may not be synchronized with the current state of the system, it can be updated pressing the Refresh button. This can be used also to force the reload of specific parameters like the RSSI or dynamic IP addresses. The refresh procedure reads all the needed parameters from the system and can take several seconds before updating.

That is, packets must be routed from this interface to another interface that is configured as WAN. The interface is automatically brought up at boot.

Layer 2 Only: only the Layer 2 portion of the interface will be configured. The interface is automatically brought up at boot. Configure Manually: allows manual entry of the IP Address and Netmask fields, if the interface is configured as LAN; allows manual entry of the IP Address , Netmask , Gateway , and DNS Servers fields, if the interface is designated as WAN. Using DHCP: configures the interface as a DHCP client obtaining the IP address from a network DHCP server. IP Address - defines the IP address of the interface, if manually configured. Subnet Mask - defines the subnet mask of the interface, if manually configured. Gateway - specifies the default gateway for the unit.

DHCP Beginning Address : specifies the first address of DHCP pool (i.e., first available client IP address). DHCP Ending Address : specifies the last address of DHCP pool (i.e., last IP address that can be assigned to a client). DHCP Subnet Mask : defines the subnet mask that is assigned to a client. DHCP Default Lease Time : sets the default time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. DHCP Max Lease Time : sets the maximum time (in minutes) that the client retains the provided IP address. It must be greater than 0. Pass DNS Servers through DHCP : enables DNS Proxy (i.e., passing DNS servers through DHCP).

This type of network address translation maps multiple IP addresses on the LAN side to a single IP address on the WAN side, allowing internet access from hosts on a local network via a gateway (WAN) interface.

It uses the associated KeystoreService to access the trust certificates, private keys pairs needed to setup a SSL connection. It also enforces best practices that are not enabled by default in the Java VM, such as, enabling hostname verification, disabling the legacy SSL-2.0-compatible Client Hello, and disabling the Nagle algorithm. The list of all available SSL Service instances is available in the SSL Configuration tab of the Security section, accessible only by the users with the corresponding permission. By default, the framework creates a SSLManagerService instance with the org.eclipse.kura.ssl.SslManagerService PID. This instance is generally used by all the core services of the framework. A new SSL Service instance can be created using the New Button, by specifying the desired factory and the Service PID that will be associated with this new instance. An instance of the default org.eclipse.kura.ssl.SslManagerService factory has the following configuration parameters: KeystoreService Target Filter - specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the KeystoreService used to manage the SSL key store (Required field). Truststore Target Filter - specifies, as an OSGi target filter, the pid of the KeystoreService used to manage the SSL trust store. If the target service cannot be found, the service configured with the Keystore Target Filter parameter will be used as truststore. ssl.default.protocol - defines the allowed SSL protocol. ssl.hostname.verification - indicates whether hostname verification is enabled or disabled. ssl.default.cipherSuites - defines the allowed cipher suites. By selecting the Select available targets button, the user can associate the SSLManagerService instance with the corresponding KeystoreService instances available in the framework runtime. Server SSL Certificate The device requires a public key in its trust store in order to authenticate the broker and be able to setup an SSL connection. Kura is distributed with a pre-initialized SSL keystore that contains only some of the major Certification Authorities (CA) public keys. If the broker uses a certificate signed by a different CA, or uses an auto-signed certificate, the system administrator must setup Kura with the correct certificates used to trust the remote cloud broker. The inclusion of public certificates is accomplished with the Server SSL Certificate feature. To do so, the SSL Certificates form must be completed by providing a certificate or a certificates chain to be trusted and defining the alias used to register this new data in the device's trust store. With this feature, when the device tries to instantiate an SSL connection with the broker, it receives the broker's public key chain. The SSL connection is secured only if the received chain is trusted. This connection can only happen if one of the certificates that compose the broker chain are available in the device's trust store. When instantiating the device's trust store, the user decides whether to add a single certificate (leaf or CA certificate) or the full chain. In the latter case, the chain should be provided by specifying the leaf certificate, followed by the CA certificate that is signing it, and so on, until the root CA is reached. An example of this scenario is depicted in the following image: Device SSL Certificate & Mutual Authentication Mutual authentication is a technique that allows authentication of the device that is connecting to the broker. The form available in Certificates List may be used to specify the keys needed to enable mutual authentication. This authentication may be accomplished by specifying a couple of certificates (private and public keys) to be used by the client device to authenticate itself to the broker. This authentication is possible because the broker has the root CA certificate that has been used to sign the couple held by the device. In this way, the authenticity of the couple of certificates held by the device may be verified, and therefore, enable the two communicating parts (the broker and the device) to trust each other. To enable mutual authentication, the user must complete the form with a well-formed key pair (public and private), and with an alias value that corresponds with the account name used to connect to the broker. Key Pair Generation The keys may be generated using specific software, such as OpenSSL or Keytool . This section describes how to use OpenSSL to generate a couple of private and public keys. The private key may be created using the following command: openssl genrsa -out certsDirectory/certs/certificate.key 1024 This command creates a new, 1024-bit private key in the specified path. This key is used to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file, which is used by a CA to authenticate the certificate's creator. A CSR file is created with OpenSSL using the following command: openssl req -new -key certsDirectory/certs/certificate.key -out certsDirectory/crl/certificate.csr If the user is creating their own certificate chain, the CSR file may be signed using a personal CA. This process may be accomplished using OpenSSL with the following command: openssl ca -config certsDirectory/openssl.cnf -days 3650 -keyfile certsDirectory/ca/ca.key -cert certsDirectory/ca/ca.pem -out certsDirectory/certs/certificate.pem -infiles certsDirectory/crl/certificate.csr The parameters are defined as follows: -config : specifies the OpenSSL configuration file that must be used to sign the certificate. -days : specifies how long the certificate is valid. -keyfile and -cert : allow the specification of the CA that will sign the CSR file. -out : identifies the location and the name of the signed certificate that will be created. -infiles : identifies the location of the CSR file that has to be signed. Tip The private key may not be placed into the Kura Gateway Administration Console without a format conversion. OpenSSL offers the following command to convert the input private key to a non-encrypted PKCS#8 format that may be processed by the Kura code: openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in inPrivateKey.key -out outKey.pem -nocrypt","title":"SSL Configuration"},{"location":"gateway-configuration/ssl-configuration/#ssl-configuration","text":"A SSL Service instance manages the configuration of the SSL connections.

In addition to the TCP/IP and DHCP & NAT configuration tabs, it has the Wireless tab that allows for the configuration of wireless settings. These configuration options are described below. Warning Before using wifi make sure that you have correctly set the Regulatory Domain on the gateway. You can check the current configuration using the iw reg get command. To set the Regulatory Domain please refer to the specific section in the Gateway Configurations. Wireless Configuration The Wireless tab contains the following configuration parameters: Wireless Mode : defines the mode of operation. Access Point: creates a wireless access point. Station Mode: connects to a wireless access point. Network Name : specifies the Service Set Identifier (SSID). In Access Point mode, this is the SSID that identifies this wireless network. In Station mode, this is the SSID of a wireless network to connect to. Radio Mode : defines 802.11 mode. 802.11 ac/n/a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) 802.11n/g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) Wireless Security : sets the security protocol for the wireless network. None: No Wi-Fi security WEP: Wired Equivalent Privacy WPA: Wi-Fi Protected Access WPA2: Wi-Fi Protected Access II Wireless Password : sets the password for the wireless network. WEP: 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key WPA/WPA2: pre-shared key Verify Password : sets the password verification field. In Access Point mode, allows the wireless password to be retyped for verification. In Station mode, this field is disabled. Pairwise Ciphers : lists accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Group Ciphers : lists accepted group (broadcast/multicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Bgscan Module : requests background scans for the purpose of roaming within an ESS (i.e., within a single network block with all the APs using the same SSID). None: background scan is disabled Simple: periodic background scans based on signal strength Learn: learn channels used by the network and try to avoid bgscans on other channels Bgscan Signal Strength Threshold : defines a threshold (in dBm) that determines which one of the following two parameters (i.e., Short Interval or Long Interval ) will be effective. Bgscan Short Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is worse than signal_strength. Bgscan Long Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is better than signal_strength. Ping Access Point & renew DHCP lease if not reachable : enables pinging the access point after connection is established. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, if set to true , the unit will ping the access point and attempt to renew the DHCP lease if the access point is not reachable. Ignore Broadcast SSID : operates as follows if set to true : In Access Point mode, sends an empty SSID in beacons and ignores probe request frames that do not specify full SSID. In Station mode, does not scan for the SSID before attempting to associate. Channels table : allows the selection of desired channel frequencies. The availability of the desired frequency is subject to the Regdom set on the device. For a list of limitations in different countries you can consult the following page: List of WLAN channels . Channels marked as No Irradiation and Radar Detection can be used only if DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) is supported by the Wi-Fi chip. In Access Point mode, only one channel may be selected. In Station mode, the list of available channels depends on the selected Radio Mode. The selected radio mode also affects the ability to select a network in the scan window (if the channel associated with the network is not enabled in the regulatory domain an error message will be shown). Wi-Fi Station Mode Configuration In addition to the options described above, the Wireless configuration display provides two buttons that help to configure Wi-Fi in the Station mode. These buttons are described below. Access Point Scan : clicking this button triggers access point scan operations. Upon a successful scan, a table containing access points within range is presented. This table contains the following information: SSID MAC Address Signal Strength (in dBm) Channel Frequency Security If you select one of these access points, respective wireless controls (i.e., Network Name , Wireless Security , and Channel ) are filled with information obtained during the scan operation. Password Verification : clicking this button triggers password verification before a full connection is established. Wi-Fi Linux Configuration This section describes the changes applied by Kura at the Linux networking configuration. Please read the following note before proceeding with manual changes of the Linux networking configuration. Warning It is NOT recommended performing manual editing of the Linux networking configuration files when the gateway configuration is being managed through Kura. While Linux may correctly accept manual changes, Kura may not be able to interpret the new configuration resulting in an inconsistent state.

In Access Point mode, this is the SSID that identifies this wireless network. In Station mode, this is the SSID of a wireless network to connect to. Radio Mode : defines 802.11 mode. 802.11 ac/n/a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) 802.11n/g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11g/b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11b (2.4Ghz only) 802.11a (either in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz depending on the choosen channel) Wireless Security : sets the security protocol for the wireless network. None: No Wi-Fi security WEP: Wired Equivalent Privacy WPA: Wi-Fi Protected Access WPA2: Wi-Fi Protected Access II Wireless Password : sets the password for the wireless network. WEP: 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key WPA/WPA2: pre-shared key Verify Password : sets the password verification field. In Access Point mode, allows the wireless password to be retyped for verification. In Station mode, this field is disabled. Pairwise Ciphers : lists accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Group Ciphers : lists accepted group (broadcast/multicast) ciphers for WPA/WPA2. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, CCMP (AES-based encryption mode with strong security) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) CCMP and TKIP Bgscan Module : requests background scans for the purpose of roaming within an ESS (i.e., within a single network block with all the APs using the same SSID). None: background scan is disabled Simple: periodic background scans based on signal strength Learn: learn channels used by the network and try to avoid bgscans on other channels Bgscan Signal Strength Threshold : defines a threshold (in dBm) that determines which one of the following two parameters (i.e., Short Interval or Long Interval ) will be effective. Bgscan Short Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is worse than signal_strength. Bgscan Long Interval : defines the interval between background scans (in seconds) if the actual signal level of the currently connected access point is better than signal_strength. Ping Access Point & renew DHCP lease if not reachable : enables pinging the access point after connection is established. In Access Point mode, this option is disabled. In Station mode, if set to true , the unit will ping the access point and attempt to renew the DHCP lease if the access point is not reachable. Ignore Broadcast SSID : operates as follows if set to true : In Access Point mode, sends an empty SSID in beacons and ignores probe request frames that do not specify full SSID. In Station mode, does not scan for the SSID before attempting to associate. Channels table : allows the selection of desired channel frequencies. The availability of the desired frequency is subject to the Regdom set on the device. For a list of limitations in different countries you can consult the following page: List of WLAN channels . Channels marked as No Irradiation and Radar Detection can be used only if DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) is supported by the Wi-Fi chip. In Access Point mode, only one channel may be selected. In Station mode, the list of available channels depends on the selected Radio Mode. The selected radio mode also affects the ability to select a network in the scan window (if the channel associated with the network is not enabled in the regulatory domain an error message will be shown).","title":"Wireless Configuration"},{"location":"gateway-configuration/wifi-configuration/#wi-fi-station-mode-configuration","text":"In addition to the options described above, the Wireless configuration display provides two buttons that help to configure Wi-Fi in the Station mode.

This bundle will interact with the Kura ConfigurationService via the ConfigurableComponent interface. It also uses the MQTT services in Kura to connect to the Cloud, which allows for a local configuration mechanism using a Web user-interface (UI). In this example, you will learn how to perform the following functions: Create a plugin project Implement the ConfigurableComponent interface Use the Kura web UI to modify the bundle\u2019s configuration Export a single OSGi bundle (plug-in) Prerequisites Requires Kura development environment set-up ( Setting up Kura Development Environment ) Implements the use of Kura web user-interface (UI) Configurable Component Example Create Plug-in In Eclipse, create a new Plug-in project by selecting File | New | Project . Select Plug-in Development | Plug-in Project and click Next . Your screen should display the New Plug-in Project dialog box as shown in the following screen capture. Enter your project a name, such as \u201corg.eclipse.kura.example.configurable\u201d. Under Target Platform, ensure that the an OSGi framework option button is selected and set to standard as shown below. You can also (optionally) add projects to a working set. To continue, click Next . In the next New Plug-in Project menu (shown below), change the Name field to something more descriptive, such as \u201cConfigurable Component Example.\u201d Make sure that the Execution Environment list is set to match the JVM version running on the target device ( JavaSE-1.6 or JavaSE-1.7 ). To determine the JVM version running on the target device, log in to its administrative console and enter the command java \u2013version Also, un check the Generate an activator, a Java class that controls the plug-in\u2019s life cycle option button. For the purposes of this example, a single class will be used. An Activator class will not be created; instead, OSGi Declarative Services will be used to start and stop the bundle. Finally, click Finish . You should see the new project in the Package Explorer (or Project Explorer) in Eclipse. Also, you will see the MANIFEST.MF was automatically opened in the Manifest Editor. An OSGi bundle is a regular Java .jar file that contains Java code and resources and a custom Manifest and an Activator. The manifest will be modified in the next section. Add Dependencies to Manifest First, you will use the Manifest Editor in Eclipse to add some dependencies. Click the Dependencies tab at the bottom of the editor screen and then click the Automated Management of Dependencies heading to expand it. Under Automated Management of Dependencies, click Add . In the Select a Plug-in field, enter org.eclipse.osgi.services . Select the plug-in name and click OK . Note that this operation is very much like adding standalone jars to the buildpath by including the \u2018-cp\u2019 argument to javac. However, in this case you are telling Eclipse where to find these dependencies the \u201cOSGi way\u201d, so it is aware of them at compile time. Click Add again and use the same procedure to add the following dependencies: slf4j.api org.eclipse.kura.api You should now see the list of dependencies. Save changes to the Manifest. Create Java Class Now you are ready to start writing a simple Java class. Right-click the org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable project. Select New | Class . Set the Package field to org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable , set the Name field to ConfigurableExample , and then click Finish . Write the following code for the new class. You can copy and paste the code provided below into your newly created Java class file. package org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable ; public class ConfigurableExample implements ConfigurableComponent { private static final Logger s_logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( ConfigurableExample . class ); private static final String APP_ID = \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" ; private Map < String , Object > properties ; protected void activate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has started!\" ); } protected void activate ( ComponentContext componentContext , Map < String , Object > properties ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has started with config!\" ); updated ( properties ); } protected void deactivate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has stopped!\" ); } public void updated ( Map < String , Object > properties ) { this . properties = properties ; if ( properties != null && ! properties . isEmpty ()) { Iterator < Entry < String , Object >> it = properties . entrySet (). iterator (); while ( it . hasNext ()) { Entry < String , Object > entry = it . next (); s_logger . info ( \"New property - \" + entry . getKey () + \" = \" + entry . getValue () + \" of type \" + entry . getValue (). getClass (). toString ()); } } } } The activate() method is the entry point when the bundle is started. Note this class has two forms of the activate() method. The second method (with the \u201cMap properties\u201d parameter) enables a default configuration to be specified at bundle start time. The deactivate() method is the entry point when the bundle is stopped. You have also specified an updated() method. These methods define how the bundle receives a new configuration from the Kura configuration manager. Kura handles robust configuration management routines automatically once you implement the ConfigurableComponent interface and the updated() method. Resolve Dependencies At this point, there will be errors in your code because of unresolved imports. Select the menu Source | Organize Imports to resolve these errors. Because you added dependencies to your dependency list in the Manifest, you will be prompted to choose one of the following two potential sources for importing a few classes. For the \u201cEntry\u201d class, select java.util.Map.Entry as shown below and click Next . For the \u201cLogger\u201d class, select org.slf4j.Logger as shown below and click Finish . Resolving the imports should clear the errors in the class as shown in the screen capture that follows. Save the changes to the ConfigurableExample class. The complete set of code (with import statements) is shown below. package org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable ; import java.util.Iterator ; import java.util.Map ; import java.util.Map.Entry ; import org.osgi.service.component.ComponentContext ; import org.slf4j.Logger ; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory ; import org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent ; public class ConfigurableExample implements ConfigurableComponent { private static final Logger s_logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( ConfigurableExample . class ); private static final String APP_ID * = \"org.eclipse.kura.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" ; private Map < String , Object > properties ; protected void activate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has started!\" ); } protected void activate ( ComponentContext componentContext , Map < String , Object > properties ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has started with config!\" ); updated ( properties ); } protected void deactivate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has stopped!\" ); } public void updated ( Map < String , Object > properties ) { this . properties = properties ; if ( properties != null && ! properties . isEmpty ()) { Iterator < Entry < String , Object >> it = properties . entrySet (). iterator (); while ( it . hasNext ()) { Entry < String , Object > entry = it . next (); s_logger . info ( \"New property - \" + entry . getKey () + \" = \" + entry . getValue () + \" of type \" + entry . getValue (). getClass (). toString ()); } } } } Switch back to the Manifest Editor. Under Automated Management of Dependencies , ensure the Import-Package option button is selected. Click the add dependencies link to automatically add packages to the dependencies list (under Imported Packages ) based on the \u201cimport\u201d statements in your example code. Save changes to the Manifest again. Create Component Class Right-click the example project and select New | Folder . Create a new folder named \u201cOSGI-INF\u201d. Now, right-click the example project\u2019s \u201cOSGI-INF\u201d folder and select New | Other . From the wizard, select Plug-in Development | Component Definition and click Next . Next to the Class field, click Browse and type the name of your newly created class in the Select entries field. In this case, type the word \u201cConfigurable\u201d, and you will see matching items. Select the ConfigurableExample class and click OK . In the Enter or select the parent folder field, make sure \u201c /OSGI-INF\u201d is at the end of the existing entry (e.g., org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable/OSGI-INF). Set the Name field equal to the Class field as shown below: Click Finish . After the Component class has been created, it will open in the Workspace. On the Services tab, click the Add button under Provided Services . Enter \u201cconfigurable\u201d and select the interface \u201corg.eclipse.kura.example.configurable\u201d. This is required for components that are configurable through the Kura ConfigurationService, so that they expose a Service. In the Overview tab, the Name and Class fields should already point to your Java class. Make the following settings: Set the Activate field to activate and set the Deactivate field to deactivate . This tells the component where these OSGi activation methods are located. Set the Configuration Policy to require . Set the Modified field to updated . This tells the component which method to call when the configuration is updated. Uncheck the box This component is enabled when started , then check both boxes This component is enabled when started and This component is immediately activated . Click the Add Property button. Enter a property with the name \u201cservice.pid\u201d and value \u201corg.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\u201d as shown in the screen capture below. Verify that the completed Overview tab looks like the screen shot shown below and save the Component class definition file: Check the Source tab of the component.xml file and carefully verify that each of the property values and tags match what is shown below: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" activate= \"activate\" configuration-policy= \"require\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" modified= \"updated\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" /> </service> <property name= \"service.pid\" type= \"String\" value= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" /> </scr:component> If Kura 3.0 or newer versions are used and the \"org.eclipse.kura.core.configuration.legacyServiceTracking\" system property is set to false or not set, proceed as follows. After the Component class has been created, it will open in the Workspace. On the Services tab, click the Add button under Provided Services . Enter \u201cconfigurable\u201d and select the interface \u201corg.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\u201d. This is required for components that are configurable through the Kura ConfigurationService, so that they expose a Service. In the Overview tab, the Name and Class fields should already point to your Java class. Make the following settings: Set the Activate field to activate and set the Deactivate field to deactivate .

This tells the component which method to call when the configuration is updated. Uncheck the box This component is enabled when started , then check both boxes This component is enabled when started and This component is immediately activated . Click the Add Property button. Enter a property with the name \u201cservice.pid\u201d and value \u201corg.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\u201d as shown in the screen capture below. Verify that the completed Overview tab looks like the screen shot shown below and save the Component class definition file: Check the Source tab of the component.xml file and carefully verify that each of the property values and tags match what is shown below: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" activate= \"activate\" configuration-policy= \"require\" deactivate= \"deactivate\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" modified= \"updated\" name= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" > <implementation class= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.configuration.ConfigurableComponent\" /> </service> <property name= \"service.pid\" type= \"String\" value= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" /> </scr:component> Create the Default Configuration With the component definition file created, you also need to specify the configurable parameters of this bundle. This is done using the \u201cmetatype\u201d definition. Right-click the OSGI-INF directory for the example project in the Package Explorer window and select New | Folder. Name the folder \u201cmetatype\u201d. Next, right-click the metatype folder and select New | File . Name the file \u201corg.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample.xml\u201d as shown in the following screen capture: At this point, you have to write the \u2018metatype\u2019 file that defines the parameters, default values, types, etc. Click on the Source button and paste the following XML text into ConfigurableExample.xml for this example. Save changes to ConfigurableExample.xml. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <MetaData xmlns= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/metatype/v1.2.0\" localization= \"en_us\" > <OCD id= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" name= \"ConfigurableExample\" description= \"This is a sample metatype file for a simple configurable component\" > <AD id= \"param1.string\" name= \"param1.string\" type= \"String\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"Some Text\" description= \"String configuration parameter\" /> <AD id= \"param2.float\" name= \"param2.float\" type= \"Float\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"false\" default= \"20.5\" min= \"5.0\" max= \"40.0\" description= \"Float configuration parameter\" /> <AD id= \"param3.integer\" name= \"param3.integer\" type= \"Integer\" cardinality= \"0\" required= \"true\" default= \"2\" min= \"1\" description= \"Integer configuration parameter\" /> </OCD> <Designate pid= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" > <Object ocdref= \"org.eclipse.kura.example.configurable.ConfigurableExample\" /> </Designate> </MetaData> In the MANIFEST.MF of this bundle, you must also make sure the XML file gets packaged into the bundle when you export the plug-in. Click the Build tab, and in the Binary Build section of the Manifest editor verify that all the checkboxes for items under META-INF and OSGI-INF are checked. Save the Manifest after making this change. Run the Bundle At this point, you can run the bundle using the emulator in Eclipse (Linux or OS X only). To do so, expand the org.eclipse.kura.emulator project in the package explorer and browse to src/main/resources. As appropriate for you platform type, right-click Kura_Emulator_ [OS] .launch (where \u201c [OS] \u201d specifies your operating system) and select Run as | KURA_EMULATOR_ [OS] .launch . Doing so will start the Kura emulator and your new bundle in the console window of Eclipse. View the Bundle Configuration in the Local Web UI With the bundle running, open a browser window on the same computer as the Eclipse development environment and browse to the Kura web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080 . Once connected to the Kura web UI, a log in window appears prompting you to enter the Name and Password as shown below: Enter the appropriate name and password (default is admin/admin) and click Log in . The Kura Admin web UI appears with the ConfigurableExample in the Services area on the left side of the browser window as shown below: From the Kura Admin web UI, you can change the parameters that are used by the Kura configuration manager and in turn call the updated() method of the newly created bundle. To do so, click ConfigurableExample and the configurable component parameters will be displayed as shown below: Make any necessary changes and click the Apply button near the top left of the configuration pane for the modifications to take affect. Every time a change is made to the configuration, a new snapshot is generated along with an ID.","title":"Configurable Application"},{"location":"java-application-development/configurable-application/#configurable-application","text":"","title":"Configurable Application"},{"location":"java-application-development/configurable-application/#overview","text":"This section provides a simple example of how to create an OSGi bundle that implements the ConfigurableComponent interface in Kura.

The application utilizes the Kura ConfigurableComponent interface to be able to receive configuration updates through the local Kura web UI. In addition, this bundle utilizes OSGi declarative services and the Kura CloudClientListener. This tutorial demonstrates how to modify configurations of custom bundles and shows how those configuration changes can dynamically impact the behavior of the bundle through the Kura web UI. Code Walkthrough The following sections will highlight three important API layers when creating an application that will publish to the cloud. These layers are: DataTransportService Available for standard MQTT messaging. Allows consumers of the service to connect to brokers, publish messages, and receive messages on subscribed topics DataService Delegates data transport to the DataTransportService Provides extended features for managing broker connections, buffering of published messages, and priority based delivery of messages CloudService Further extends the functionality of DataService Provides means for more complex flows (i.e. request/response) Manages single broker connection across multiple applications Provides payload data model with encoding/decoding serializers Publishes life cycle manages for devices and applications Acquiring CloudClient The CloudService can manage multiple applications over a shared MQTT connection by treating each application as a client. The example code uses the \"setCloudService\" and \"unsetCloudService\" methods for referencing and releasing the CloudService. In the bundles activate method, the service reference in conjunction with a unique application ID can then be used to obtain a CloudClient. The relevant code is shown below (ommitted sections are denoted by ==OMMITTED==): == OMMITTED == // Cloud Application identifier private static final String APP_ID = \"heater\" ; == OMMITTED == public void setCloudService ( CloudService cloudService ) { m_cloudService = cloudService ; } public void unsetCloudService ( CloudService cloudService ) { m_cloudService = null ; } == OMMITTED == // Acquire a Cloud Application Client for this Application s_logger . info ( \"Getting CloudClient for {}...\" , APP_ID ); m_cloudClient = m_cloudService . newCloudClient ( APP_ID ); Publishing/Subscribing The private \"doPublish\" method is used to publish messages at a fixed rate. The method demonstrates how to use the CloudClient and KuraPayload to publish MQTT messages. == OMMITTED == // Allocate a new payload KuraPayload payload = new KuraPayload (); // Timestamp the message payload . setTimestamp ( new Date ()); // Add the temperature as a metric to the payload payload . addMetric ( \"temperatureInternal\" , m_temperature ); payload . addMetric ( \"temperatureExternal\" , 5.0F ); payload . addMetric ( \"temperatureExhaust\" , 30.0F ); int code = m_random . nextInt (); if (( m_random . nextInt () % 5 ) == 0 ) { payload . addMetric ( \"errorCode\" , code ); } else { payload . addMetric ( \"errorCode\" , 0 ); } // Publish the message try { m_cloudClient . publish ( topic , payload , qos , retain ); s_logger . info ( \"Published to {} message: {}\" , topic , payload ); } catch ( Exception e ) { s_logger . error ( \"Cannot publish topic: \" + topic , e ); } Similarly, the CloudClient can be used to subscribe to MQTT topics. Although not shown in the example code, the following snippet could be added to subscribe to all published messages: m_cloudClient . subscribe ( topic , qos ); Callback Methods The example class implements CloudClientListener, which provides methods for several common callback methods. The below snippet shows the relevant code for creating the listeners for the demo application. == OMMITTED == public class Heater implements ConfigurableComponent , CloudClientListener == OMMITTED == m_cloudClient . addCloudClientListener ( this ); The available methods for implementation are: onControlMessageArrived: Method called when a control message is received from the broker. onMessageArrived: Method called when a data message is received from the broker. onConnectionLost: Method called when the client has lost connection with the broker. onConnectionEstablished: Method called when the client establishes a connection with the broker. onMessageConfirmed: Method called when a published message has been fully acknowledged by the broker (not applicable for qos 0 messages). onMessagePublished: Method called when a message has been transfered from the publishing queue to the DataTransportService. For more information on the various Kura APIs, please review the Kura APIs Run the Bundle By default, the heater demo bundle does not run automatically. To run the bundle and Kura in the Emulator, locate the org.eclipse.kura.emulator project. Expand it to show the src/main/resources folder. Right-click the correct Kura_Emulator_ [OS] .launch file, depending on which operating system you are running. In the context menu, select the Run As option, and click on Run Configurations . Under OSGi Framework (Run Configurations window shown below), click on the Kura_Emulator_[OS] entry. In the Bundles tab under Workspace, enable the org.eclipse.kura.demo.heater checkbox to enable it as shown below: Click the Apply and Run buttons to start the Kura Emulator. Once this setting has been made, you only need to right-click on the launch file and select Run As and the Kura_Emulator_[OS] option to run with the same settings. This will start Kura running locally and will display a Console window in Eclipse. The Console window will show the OSGi diagnostics as various bundles start and execute. Configure the MQTT Client With the heater demo bundle running, open a browser window on the same computer as the Eclipse development environment and browse to the Kura web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080 . Once connected to the Kura web UI, a log in window appears prompting you to enter the Name and Password as shown below: Enter the appropriate name and password (default is admin/admin) and click Log in . The Kura Admin web UI appears as shown below: From the Kura web UI, click on MqttDataTransport in the Services pane on the lower left of the browser window. You will see a menu similar to the one shown in the following screen capture: Fill in the following fields then click the Apply button: Field Value broker-url: The url for the MQTT broker (this example shows the MQTT broker-url mqtt://iot.eclipse.org:1883/ hosted by the Eclipse Foundation) topic.context.account-name: Your [account_name] username: Typically [account_name]_broker password: The password for your user client-id The client identifier to be used when connecting to the MQTT broker (optional) Now that the account credentials are set in the MqttDataTransport service, the DataService needs to be configured to connect by default. To do so, click DataService in the Services area on the left of the browser window. For the \u2018connect.auto-on-startup\u2019 parameter, select true as shown below: Modify Bundle Configuration in Local Web UI Bundles changes may be made directly in the emulator web UI. Since you are running an emulated device in Eclipse, you can do this by browsing to http://127.0.0.1:8080 (same URL where the MQTT client was configured in the previous section of this tutorial). If the bundle was running on a real device and you had network access to it, you would browse to http://[ip_address_of_device] . From the Kura web UI, select the Heater bundle from the configurable services on the left and modify the parameters as needed (shown in the screen capture below). By default, the heater demo is configured according to the following characteristics and assumptions about its operational environment: Start operation is at 6:00am (06:00). End operation is at 10:00pm (22:00). It is colder outside than inside the heated chamber (hard-coded to 5 degrees in the application). Output of the heater is constant at 30 degrees (hard-coded). When in operational mode, the temperature will drop inside if the heater is off. The heater turns off when it is about to exceed the setPoint defined in the configuration. After the temperature drops to four times the increment point (a made-up value to show dropping temperature, hard-coded in the application), the heater turns back on, and the temperature starts increment at the rate of the \u2018temperature.increment\u2019 rate. Click Apply for changes to take affect. The updated() method is called after settings are applied for the new configuration. After completing this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you review the heater demo source code in Eclipse to see how it is put together. Kura automatically generates the user configuration interface through implementation of the ConfigurableComponent interface and some small additions to the component.xml file (called heater.xml). This powerful feature provides both a local and remote configuration user interface with no additional development requirements.","title":"Connected Application"},{"location":"java-application-development/connected-application/#connected-application","text":"","title":"Connected Application"},{"location":"java-application-development/connected-application/#overview","text":"This section describes the prepackaged heater demo bundle that comes with the Kura development environment and demonstrates how to perform the following functions: Run the Kura Emulator Connect to the Cloud Gain an understanding of ConfigurableComponents in Kura Modify configurations of custom bundles","title":"Overview"},{"location":"java-application-development/connected-application/#prerequisites","text":"Setting up Kura Development Environment Using the Kura web UI","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"java-application-development/connected-application/#heater-demo-introduction","text":"The org.eclipse.kura.demo.heater bundle is a simple OSGi bundle that represents a thermostat and heater combination.

These instructions use the \u201cHello World\u201d OSGi project created in the previous section . In this example, you will learn how to perform the following functions: Use local OSGi emulation mode in Eclipse Deploy a bundle to a remote target running the OSGi Framework Install a Deployment Package to a remote target running the OSGi Framework Manage OSGi bundles on a target device Set bundle Logger levels in Kura Prerequisites Setting up Kura Development Environment Hello World Using the Kura Logger Testing the OSGi Plug-in Once you have created an OSGi plug-in, you can test it in Local Emulation Mode and/or deploy it to a Remote Target Device . Local Emulation Mode The Kura user workspace can be used in Eclipse in local emulation mode (Linux/OS X only; this feature is not currently supported under Windows). To deploy the code to a running system, see the section Remote Target Device . Run Kura in Emulator Mode In the Eclipse workspace, locate the org.eclipse.kura.emulator project. Expand it to show the src/main/resources folder. Right-click the Kura_Emulator.launch file. In the context menu, select the Run as option, and select the Kura_Emulator *. This will start Kura running locally and will display a Console window in the bottom pane in Eclipse. The Console window will show the OSGi diagnostics as various bundles start and execute. Because the org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi bundle is in the workspace with a valid activate() method, it is automatically started with the Kura OSGi framework. Note the INFO message highlighted below that shows the bundle\u2019s activate() method was run. List OSGi Bundles in Local Mode With the OSGi framework running in the Eclipse console (refer to the previous section), click in the Console window. Press Enter/Return and then type the \u2018 ss \u2019 command to show a list of installed bundles. Note the bundle ID number for the org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi bundle. Start/Stop Bundle in Local Mode In the OSGi Console window in Eclipse, run the start ## or stop ## commands to start or stop a bundle, where the \u201c ## \u201d is either the bundle ID number or the bundle name (such as \u201cstart org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi\u201d). Note that the INFO messages for both the activate() and deactivate() messages appear in the Console window when the bundle is started or stopped. Install/Uninstall Bundle in Local Mode In the OSGi Console window in Eclipse, bundles can be installed or uninstalled. To uninstall the example bundle, issue the command \u2018 uninstall ## \u2019, where \u201c ## \u201d is either the bundle ID number or the bundle name, such as: uninstall 47 or uninstall org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi A message will appear indicating that the bundle has been stopped. Once the bundle has been uninstalled from the local OSGi console, it cannot be started or installed by number or name. Instead, it must be installed by using the plug-in JAR file created earlier. Issue the \u2018 install \u2019 command to install a bundle into the Emulation environment: install file:/[*path_to_bundle*]/[*bundle_name*].jar where \u201c[path_to_bundle] / [bundle_name] .jar\u201d should be replaced with the name of the bundle exported earlier (the section Hello World Using the Kura Logger ), as shown in the example below: install file:/Users/Nina/Documents/myPlugins/plugins/plugins/plugins/plugins/plugins/org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi_ 1.0.0.201409101740.jar Then the bundle can be started or stopped, as described in the previous section, Start/Stop Bundle in Local Mode . Optionally, you can add the flag \u2018-start \u2019 to the \u2018 install \u2019 command to automatically start the bundle after installation. Remote Target Device One or more OSGi bundles can be deployed to a remote device running Kura, either by installing separate bundle files or deployment packages using Eclipse. Warning These steps require Kura to be running on the target device. This method of deployment is temporary on the remote target device and is not persistent after a restart. To make the deployment permanent, see Making Deployment Permanent . Connect to Remote OSGi Framework To deploy a bundle to the remote target device, you will need to connect Eclipse to the OSGi framework running on the device. This is done using mToolkit. See Kura Setup for instructions on installing mToolkit into the Eclipse development environment. Select the Eclipse menu Window | Show View | Other . Select mToolkit -> Frameworks entry to open the mToolkit Frameworks view. Enter a name for the framework definition and the IP address of the target device. Close the dialog by clicking the OK button. Warning The remote target device must have port 1450 open in its firewall, in order to allow mToolkit o make a connection to its OSGi framework. If this port is not opened, refer to the section Open Port for OSGi Remote Connection . Right-click the framework icon name and select Connect Framework . The list of installed bundles and deployment packages should be retrieved shortly. (Use the Disconnect Framework option to disconnect from the remote target framework when finished.) Open Port for OSGi Remote Connection In order to allow mToolkit to make a remote connection to the OSGi framework on the target device, the device must allow the incoming port in its firewall. To set this option, open a Web browser and log into Kura using its current IP address, such as: http://10.11.5.4 Click the Firewall icon and then click the Open Ports tab. If port 1450 is not shown in the list of allowed ports, click the New button under Open Ports. Enter the port 1450 and select protocol TCP . Then click Submit . Now, click Apply to apply changes to the remote device. Install Single Bundle to Target Device With the Eclipse environment connected to the remote OSGi target framework, a single bundle can be installed on the remote device. In the mToolkit Frameworks view, right-click the Framework name and select Install Bundle . (This requires that you have exported the bundle as a deployable plug-in JAR file. See the section Hello World Using the Kura Logger .) Use the Browse button to select the JAR file and click OK to install it to the target device. The newly installed bundle should be shown in the Frameworks view under Bundles. To control operation of the bundle through the OSGi Frameworks view, right-click the bundle name. The following actions can be performed: Start \u2013 start the bundle Stop \u2013 stop the bundle Update \u2013 reinstall the bundle Install Bundle \u2013 install a different bundle Uninstall Bundle \u2013 remove this bundle from the target device Show Bundle IDs / Show Bundle Versions \u2013 show additional information about bundles You can also verify operation of the bundle on the target device itself. See the section Manage Bundles on Target Device . Install Deployment Package to Target Device With the Eclipse environment connected to the remote OSGi target framework, a deployment package can be installed on the remote device. NOTE: If you have just installed the individual bundle in the previous section, you should uninstall it before proceeding. Doing so will avoid any confusion in having the same bundle installed twice. In the mToolkit Frameworks view, right-click the Framework name and select Install Deployment Package . (This step requires that you have exported the bundle as a deployable plug-in JAR file. See the section Hello World Using the Kura Logger for instructions on exporting the OSGi bundle.) Open the resources/dp folder in the Workspace filesystem directory, select the .dp file ( not the \u201c.dpp\u201d file), and click OK . The deployment package will be installed on the target device and shown in the Frameworks view under Deployment Packages. (The deployment package can also be uninstalled from the Framework view.) The bundle included in the deployment package can also be viewed under Bundles and can be controlled remotely (start/stop) as with other bundles. The operation of the bundle can also be verified on the target device itself. See the section Manage Bundles on Target Device . Connect to OSGi on Target Device You can manage the OSGi framework on a target device by logging into a console on the device using a connected keyboard and VGA monitor or over a network connection using SSH (PuTTY in Windows or \u2018 ssh \u2019 from Linux or Mac). At the command prompt, display the Kura log file with: tail -f /var/log/kura.log Connect to the OSGi framework by typing the following commands: telnet localhost 5002 There are many commands available in the OSGi console for managing bundles. Following are just a few useful commands: Command Description ss Lists names and ID of bundles help Displays the help menu of OSGi commands lb Lists all installed bundles and IDs h [bundle IDs] Displays bundle headers (i.e., Bundle Manifest Version, Name, Required Execution Environment, Symbolic Name, Version, Import Package, Manifest Version, and Service Component) exit Exits the OSGi console and stops Kura disconnect Exits the OSGi console, but leaves Kura running Manage Bundles on Target Device From the OSGi command line, you can display a list of bundles with the \u2018 ss \u2019 command as shown in the example below: ss In this example, the org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi bundle ID is 64. You can run the \u2018 start ## \u2019 or \u2018 stop ## \u2019 commands to start or stop a bundle, where the \u201c## \u201d is either the bundle ID number or the bundle name (such as \u201c start org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi \u201d). To verify that the bundled is stopped, you can issue the \u2018 ss \u2019 command. If the bundled is stopped, the activity will show RESOLVED (as shown below). If the bundle is started, the activity will show ACTIVE (as shown above). Set Kura Logger Levels Kura logger levels are defined in a configuration file. The messages that appear require a log statement in the application and that the log level of the statement matches the log level of the application (such as logger.info or logger.debug). To set or change logger levels, the Kura logger configuration file may be modified using the vi editor. From the Linux command prompt, enter the following command: vi /opt/eclipse/kura/kura/log4j.properties At the bottom of the \u201clog4j.properties\u201d file, there will be one or more \u201clog4j\u201d logger property entries, which determine the logger level used by the bundles at startup. In the example screen capture shown below, the \u201clog4j.logger.org.eclipse.kura\u201d property has been set to \u201cINFO\u201d, which applies to all bundles that start with \u201corg.eclipse.kura.\u201d Additional, more specific, properties may be defined as required for your particular logging needs. The property entries will take on the defined logger level at startup. The logger levels are hierarchical, so that those in a deeper level of the hierarchy will apply; otherwise, the more general logger level will override them. Once you have made the necessary changes, save and close the file using the \u2018 :wq \u2019 command. Restart Kura, and check the log levels in the OSGi console again to make sure that the desired levels have taken effect. Making Deployment Permanent The mToolkit deployment of a package is a temporary installation and does not make the package permanent. Once a set of bundles has been tested on the remote target device and is ready for permanent deployment, the software can be installed on a device with deployment packages from the command line of a target device using the instructions below: Copy the deployment package file (*.dp) to the target device, into the folder: /opt/eclipse/kura/kura/packages Edit the dpa.properties file through the vi editor by entering the following command: vi /opt/eclipse/kura/kura/dpa.properties Add an entry in the dpa.properties file to include the new package name, such as: package_name=file\\:/opt/eclipse/kura/kura/packages/package_filename.dp where, \u201cpackage_name\u201d and \u201cpackage_filename\u201d should be replaced with the actual name of the deployment package. Save and close the file using the \u2018 :wq \u2019 command. Then restart Kura, and the new package should be installed in addition to the default Kura package.

The setup instructions will be the same across each OS though each system may have unique characteristics. Info The local emulation of Kura code is only supported in Linux and Mac, not in Windows. JVM Installation Download and install JDK SE 8 from the following links as appropriate for your OS. For Windows and Linux users, the JDK can be downloaded from the following link: Java SE 8 Downloads . Use the latest version of Java SE Development Kit and download the version appropriate for your system. For additional information regarding the installation of Java 8 on all supported operating systems, see JDK 8 and JRE 8 Installation Guide . Eclipse IDE The Eclipse IDE is an open source development tool that consists of an integrated development environment (IDE) and a plug-in system for managing extensions. Installing Eclipse Before installing Eclipse, you should choose directory locations for the Eclipse install and its workspaces. Info The following points should be kept in mind regarding Eclipse installs and workspaces: The directory location of the Eclipse workspaces should be chosen carefully. Once Eclipse is installed and workspaces are created, they should never be moved to another location in the file system. There may be multiple installs of Eclipse (of different or similar versions), and single instances of each install can be run simultaneously; but there should never be more that one instance of a specific install running at the same time (to avoid corruption to the Eclipse environment). Each workspace should be used with only one Eclipse install. You should avoid opening the workspace from more than one installation of Eclipse. For the purposes of this guide, only a single Eclipse installation will be covered. Download the current distribution of Eclipse for your OS from Eclipse official website . Choose the Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers . The zipped Eclipse file will be downloaded to the local file system and can be saved to a temporary location that can be deleted after Eclipse has been installed. After the file has been downloaded, it should be extracted to the Eclipse installs directory. The following screen capture shows the installation in Linux using an eclipse\\installs** directory. The Eclipse executable will then be found in the eclipse\\installs\\eclipse** directory. This installation will be different depending on the operating system. Because there may potentially be future Eclipse installs extracted into this location, before doing anything else, rename the directory, such as eclipse\\installs\\ juno1 \\ . Warning Once you begin using this Eclipse install, it should NOT be moved or renamed. Installing mToolkit An additional plugin, mToolkit, is needed to allow remote connectivity to an OSGi framework on a Kura-enabled target device. To install mToolkit into Eclipse, use the following steps: Open the Help | Install New Software... menu. Add the following URL as an update site based on your version of Eclipse Eclipse Mars and older: http://mtoolkit-mars.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com Eclipse Neon and newer: http://mtoolkit-neon.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com Install the \"mToolkit\" feature (you need to uncheck the Group items by category checkbox in order to see the feature) Restart Eclipse. In the menu Window | Show View | Other , there should be an mToolkit | Frameworks option. If so, the plugin has been installed correctly. Workspaces Creating an Eclipse Workspace Run Eclipse by clicking its executable in the install directory. When Eclipse is run for the first time, a workspace needs to be created. A single workspace will contain all the Java code/projects/bundles, Eclipse configuration parameters, and other relevant files for a specific business-level product. If the Use this as the default option is selected, the designated workspace becomes the default each time you run Eclipse. If a workspace has not already been defined, or if you are creating a different workspace for another development project, enter a new workspace name. The workspace should be named appropriate to the project/product being developed. Warning Once you begin using a particular workspace, it should NOT be moved or renamed at any time. Otherwise, select an existing workspace and click OK . After Eclipse is running, you can select the Eclipse menu File | Switch Workspace | Other to create or open a different workspace. After the new workspace opens, click the Workbench icon to display the development environment. Importing the Kura User Workspace To set up your Kura project workspace, you will need to download the Kura User Workspace archive from Eclipse Kura Download Page . From the Eclipse File menu, select the Import option. In the Import dialog box, expand the General heading, select Existing Projects into Workspace , and then click Next . Now click the Select archive file option button and browse to the archive file, such as user_workspace_archive_ .zip . Finally, click Finish to import the projects. At this point, you should have four projects in your workspace. The four projects are as follows: org.eclipse.kura.api \u2013 the core Kura API. org.eclipse.kura.demo.heater \u2013 an example project that you can use as a starting point for creating your own bundle. org.eclipse.kura.emulator \u2013 the emulator project for running Kura within Eclipse (Linux/Mac only). target-definition \u2013 a set of required bundles that are dependencies of the APIs and Kura. Eclipse will also report some errors at this point. See the next section to resolve those errors. Workspace Setup This section will guide the users to configure the development workspace environment. JRE Configuration The latest Eclipse IDEs require and configure, by default, a Java 11 environment. In order to be able to leverage and develop using the new workspace for Kura, the user will be required to perform a one-time operation to specify to the IDE a Java 8 JDK. Opening the Eclipse preferences and selecting the Installed JREs in the Java section, the user has to select an installed Java 8 instance. After applying the configuration change, the user will be prompted to align also the compiler options. To do so, selecting the Compiler entry in the Java section, the user has to select 1.8 from the list of available Java versions. After applying the changes, the user will be prompted to recompile the environment. Target Definition Setup Click the arrow next to the target-definition project in the workspace and double-click kura-equinox_ .target to open it. In the Target Definition window, click the link Set as Target Platform . Doing so will reset the target platform, rebuild the Kura projects, and clear the errors that were reported. At this point, you are ready to begin developing Kura-based applications for your target platform. Eclipse Oomph installer The Eclipse Oomph installer is an easy way to install and configure the Eclipse IDE to start developing on Kura. Download the latest Eclipse Installer appropriate for your platform from Eclipse Downloads Start the Eclipse Installer Switch to advanced mode (in simple mode you cannot add a custom installer) Select \"Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers\", select the latest \"Product Version\" and select a Java 11+ VM. Then click the Next button. Select \"Eclipse Kura\" project under the \"Eclipse Projects\" menu. If it isn't available, add a new installer that you can find here under the \"Github Projects\" menu. Then click the Next button. Update Eclipse Kura Git repository's username (prefer the anonymous HTTPS option, link to your fork) and customize further settings if you like (e.g. Root install folder, Installation folder name). Then click the Next button. Leave all Bootstrap Tasks selected and press the Finish button. Accept the licenses and unsigned content. Wait for the installation to finish, a few additional plugins will be installed. At first startup Eclipse IDE will checkout the code and perform a full build. The result will be an Eclipse IDE with all the recommended plug-ins already available, code will be checked out and built, workspace will be set up, a few Working Sets will be prepared with most projects building without errors. The next step is to get the rest of the projects to build, for which you might need to build them in the console with specific profiles available e.g. the CAN bundle. Run the Eclipse Kura Emulator To start the Eclipse Kura emulator, select the \"Eclipse Kura Emulator.launch\" profile from \"Other Projects\" -> \"setups\" -> \"launchers\" and open it with \"Run as\" -> \"Run Configurations...\".

With this example, you will learn how to perform the following functions: Create a plugin project Consume the Kura Logger service Write an OSGi Activator Export a single OSGi bundle (plug-in) Create a Deployment Package Prerequisites Setting up the Kura Development Environment Hello World Using the Kura Logger Create Hello World Plug-in In Eclipse, create a new Plug-in project by selecting File | New | Project . Select Plug-in Development | Plug-in Project and click Next . Your screen should display the New Plug-in Project dialog box as shown in the following screen capture. Enter your project a name, such as \u201corg.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi\u201d, in the appropriate field. Under Target Platform, ensure that the an OSGi framework option button is selected and set the variable to standard as shown below. You can also (optionally) add projects to a working set. To continue, click Next . In the next New Plug-in Project menu (shown below), change the Name field to a descriptive name, such as \u201cHello World Example with Logger\u201d. Also, verify that the Execution Environment list is set to match the Java JVM version running on the target device ( JavaSE-1.8 or JavaSE-11 ). To determine the JVM version running on the target device, log in to its administrative console and enter the command java \u2013version Finally, uncheck the Generate an activator, a Java class that controls the plug-in\u2019s life cycle option button. For the purposes of this example, a single class will be used. An Activator class will not be created; instead, OSGi Declarative Services will be used to start and stop the bundle. Click Finish . If the Open Associated Perspective pop-up window (shown below) appears for adding Plug-ins and Error Log views, select Yes or No depending on your development requirements. You should see the new project in the My Projects working set in the Package Explorer (or Project Explorer). Also, you will see the MANIFEST.MF was automatically opened in the Manifest Editor. An OSGi bundle is a regular Java .jar file that contains Java code and resources and a custom Manifest and an Activator. Add Dependencies to Manifest First, you will use the Manifest Editor in Eclipse to add some dependencies. Click the Dependencies tab at the bottom of the editor screen and then click the Automated Management of Dependencies heading to expand it. Under Automated Management of Dependencies, click Add . In the Select a Plug-in field, enter org.eclipse.osgi.services . Select the plug-in name and click OK . Note that this operation is very much like adding standalone jars to the buildpath by including the \u2018-cp\u2019 argument to javac. However, in this case you are telling Eclipse where to find these dependencies the \u201cOSGi way\u201d, so it is aware of them at compile time. Click Add again and use the same procedure to add the following dependency: slf4j.api You should now see the list of dependencies. Save changes to the Manifest. Create Java Class Now you are ready to start writing a simple Java class. Right-click the org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi project. Select New | Class . The New Java Class window appears as shown below. Set the Source folder to org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi/src . Set the Package field to org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi , set the Name field to HelloOsgi , and then click Finish . Write the following code for the new class. You can copy and paste the code provided below into your newly created Java class file. package org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi ; public class HelloOsgi { private static final Logger s_logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( HelloOsgi . class ); private static final String APP_ID = \"org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi\" ; protected void activate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has started!\" ); s_logger . debug ( APP_ID + \": This is a debug message.\" ); } protected void deactivate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has stopped!\" ); } } The activate() method is the entry point when the bundle in started. The deactivate() method is the entry point when the bundle is stopped. Notice the use of the private LoggerFactory.getLogger() method. If the LoggerFactory method is present (running) in the OSGi framework and your hello_osgi bundle is started, your activate method is called, and you can simply access the service by calling the getLogger() method. One convenient feature of Eclipse, auto-completion, is worth mentioning here. If you type \u2018s_logger.\u2019 (instance name of the \u201cLoggerFactory.getLogger\u201d method) and stop after the period, it will show you a list of methods implemented in that class. The examples above show two different methods used for logging messages. Logger methods include: \u201cerror\u201d, \u201cwarn\u201d, \u201cinfo\u201d, \u201cdebug\u201d, and \u201ctrace\u201d, which represent increasingly lower (more detailed) levels of log information. Logger levels should generally be used to represent the following conditions: ERROR - A serious problem has occurred that requires attention from the system administrator. WARNING - An action occurred or a condition was discovered that should be reviewed and may require action before an error occurs. It may also be used for transient issues. INFO - A report of a normal action or event. This could be a user operation, such as \"login completed\", or an automatic operation, such as a log file rotation. DEBUG - A debug message used for troubleshooting or performance monitoring. It typically contains detailed event data including things an application developer would need to know. TRACE - A fairly detailed output of diagnostic logging, such as actual bytes of a particular message being examined. Resolve Dependencies At this point, there will be errors in your code because of unresolved imports. Select the menu Source | Organize Imports to resolve these errors. Because you added the \u201corg.slf4j\u201d to your dependency list, you will be prompted to choose one of two potential sources for importing the \u201cLogger\u201d class. Select org.slf4j.Logger and click Finish . Now the errors in the class should have been resolved. Save the HelloOsgi class. The complete set of code (with import statements) is shown below. package org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi ; import org.osgi.service.component.ComponentContext ; import org.slf4j.Logger ; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory ; public class HelloOsgi { private static final Logger s_logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( HelloOsgi . class ); private static final String APP_ID = \"org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi\" ; protected void activate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has started!\" ); s_logger . debug ( APP_ID + \": This is a debug message.\" ); } protected void deactivate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Bundle \" + APP_ID + \" has stopped!\" ); } } For more information on using the Simple Logging Facade for Java (slf4j), see the Logger API . Switch back to the Manifest Editor. Under Automated Management of Dependencies, ensure the Import-Package option button is selected. Click the add dependencies link to automatically add packages to the dependencies list based on the \u201cimport\u201d statements in your example code. Save changes to the Manifest again. Create Component Class Right-click the example project and select New | Other . From the wizard, select Plug-in Development | Component Definition and click Next . Warning This option is available only if the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) is installed in Eclipse (plugins can be installed into Eclipse IDE by searching the name in the Eclipse Marketplace under the Help menu). In the Class field of the New Component Definition window shown below, click Browse. Enter the name of your newly created class in the Select entries field. In this case, type the word \u201chello\u201d, and you will see a list of matching items. Select the HelloOsgi class and click OK . In the Enter or select the parent folder field of the New Component Definition window, add \"/OSGI-INF\" to the existing entry (e.g., org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi/OSGI-INF). Then click Finish . After the Component class has been created, it will open in the Workspace. In the Overview tab, the Name and Class point to our Java class. Set the Activate field to activate and set the Deactivate field to deactivate . Doing so tells the component where these OSGi activation methods are located. Then save the Component class definition file. Deploying the Plug-in The next few sections describe how to create a stand-alone JAR file as a deployable OSGI plug-in and how to create an installable Deployment Package. An OSGi bundle is a Java archive file containing Java code, resources, and a Manifest. A Deployment Package is a set of resources grouped into a single package file that may be deployed in the OSGi framework through the Deployment Admin service and may contain one or more bundles, configuration objects, etc. Export the OSGi Bundle Your bundle can be built as a stand-alone OSGi plug-in. To do so, right-click the project and select the Export menu. This is equivalent to running javac on your project. From the wizard, select Plug-in Development | Deployable plug-ins and fragments and click Next . Under Available Plug-ins and Fragments of the Export window, ensure the newly created plug-in is selected. Under Destination, select the Directory option button and use the Browse button to select an appropriate place to save the JAR file on the local file system. NOTE: During the deployment process that is described in the following section, you will need to remember the location where this JAR file is saved. Click Finish . This will create a JAR file in the selected directory (e.g., /home/joe/myPlugins/plugins/org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi_1.0.0.jar). Create a Deployment Package Rather than creating a stand-alone plug-in, you can also create a Deployment Package that contains multiple bundles, configuration elements, etc. that can be deployed into an OSGi framework. In this example, you will simply create a Deployment Package containing the \u201chello_osgi\u201d bundle. This step requires mToolkit to be installed. (See Kura Setup for instructions on setting up the Eclipse development environment.) Right-click the project and select New | Folder . Select the org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi project and enter a folder named \u201cresources\u201d. Then repeat this step to create a folder named \u201cdp\u201d under the resources folder. The resources/dp folder will be used to store the Deployment Package. Select File | New | Other . Select OSGi | Deployment Package Definition and click Next . Ensure that the Target folder field of the New dpp file window is set to the / [project_name] /resources/dp folder. In the File name field, enter the name for the new Deployment Package file to create, such as \u201chello_osgi\u201d. A version number can also be entered in the Version field. Then click Finish . Under the resources/dp folder in your project, verify that the [filename] .dpp file was created. This is a Deployment Package Project that provides information needed to create the Deployment Package, such as its output directory, ant build file, etc. Select the Bundles tab and then click New . In the Bundle Path column, select the browse icon. Browse to the bundle\u2019s JAR file created earlier . Select the file and click Open . Doing so should populate the remaining columns as needed. Save changes to the deployment package file. In the resources/dp folder, right-click the .dpp file. Select Quick Build . A new [filename] .dp file will be created in the same directory. This is the final Deployment Package that can be installed on a remote target system. In conclusion, you were able to create a new bundle from scratch, write the Java code and Activator, modify the Manifest, and build the plug-in and/or Deployment Package that can be used in a Kura environment. The next steps will be to test your code in an Emulation mode and/or to deploy your code to a target system running Kura.

In this example, you will learn how to perform the following functions: Create a plugin that configures the network interfaces Connect to a wireless access point Create a wireless access point As written, the example code configures the device with a static Wi-Fi configuration. Typically, the device settings would be defined through the Kura Gateway Administration Console instead of through Java code. A more practical application of this example is for IP network interfaces that need to be dynamically modified based on some external trigger or condition, such as geo-fencing. The Kura framework allows the device to be programmatically changed via its APIs based on application-specific logic. Prerequisites Setting up the Eclipse Kura Development Environment Network Configuration with Kura Hardware Setup This example requires an embedded device running Kura with at least one Ethernet port and Wi-Fi support. Additionally, the Connect to an Access Point section requires a wireless access point and the following information about the access point: SSID (Network Name) Security Type (WEP, WPA, or WPA2), if any Password/Passphrase, if any Lastly, the Create an Access Point section requires: A wireless device, such as a laptop, to test the access point. Optionally, you may connect the Kura device\u2019s Ethernet port to another network and use Kura as a gateway to that network. Determine Your Network Interfaces In order to determine your network interfaces, run one of the following commands at a terminal on the embedded gateway: ifconfig -a or ip link show Typical network interfaces will appear as follows: lo - loopback interface eth0 - first Ethernet network interface wlan0 - first wireless network interface ppp0 - first point-to-point protocol network interface, which could be a dial-up modem, PPTP VPN connection, cellular modem, etc. Make note of your wireless interface. For this tutorial, we will assume the wireless interface name is \u2018wlan0\u2019. Kura Networking API The networking API consists of two basic services: org.eclipse.kura.net.NetworkService and org.eclipse.kura.net.NetworkAdminService . The NetworkService is used to get the current state of the network. For example, the getNetworkInterfaces() method will return a List of NetInterface objects (such as EthernetInterface or WifiInterface) for each interface. This provides a detailed representation of the current state of that interface, such as its type, whether it is currently up, and its current address, which is returned by the getNetInterfaceAddresses() method as a List of NetInterfaceAddress objects. The NetworkService can also be used to get a list of all the network interface names available on the system, or a list of all the Wi-Fi access points that are currently detected by the system. The NetworkAdminService is used to get and set the configuration for each interface. Similar to the NetworkService, it has a getNetworkInterfaceConfigs() that returns a List of NetInterfaceConfig objects (such as EthernetInterfaceConfig and WifiInterfaceConfig) for each interface. These have the same methods as a NetInterface object but represent the current configuration for that interface. For a NetInterfaceConfig object, the getNetInterfaceAddress() method will return a List of NetInterfaceAddressConfig objects. These NetInterfaceAddressConfig instances, in turn, contain a List of NetConfig objects that define the configuration for that interface. There are many types of NetConfig objects, including: NetConfigIP4 - contains the IPv4 address configuration WifiConfig - contains the Wi-Fi configuration. Note that a WifiInterfaceAddressConfig may contain multiple WifiConfigs, since a configuration might exist for one or more Wi-Fi modes. The currently active WifiConfig is the one with a WifiMode that matches the WifiInterfaceAddressConfig WifiMode. DhcpServerConfigIP4 - contains the IPv4-based DHCP server configuration DnsServerConfigIP4 - contains the IPv4-based DNS server configuration FirewallNatConfig - contains the firewall NAT configuration These NetConfigs can also be used to configure an interface by providing them as a list to the updateEthernetInterfaceConfig() , updateWifiInterfaceConfig() , or updateModemInterfaceConfig() methods in the NetworkAdminService. Connect to an Access Point In this section, you will develop a Kura network configuration bundle that sets up the Wi-Fi interface as a client to a wireless access point. Implement the Bundle To implement the network configuration bundle, perform the following steps: Note For more detailed information about bundle development (i.e., the plug-in project, classes, and MANIFEST file configuration), please refer to the Hello World Application Create a Plug-in Project named org.eclipse.kura.example.network ; set the an OSGi framework option to standard ; uncheck the Generate an activator option; and set the Execution Environment variable to match the JVM on your target device. Include the following bundles in the MANIFEST.MF: org.eclipse.kura org.eclipse.kura.net org.eclipse.kura.net.dhcp org.eclipse.kura.net.firewall org.eclipse.kura.net.wifi org.osgi.service.component org.slf4j Create a class named NetworkConfigExample in the org.eclipse.kura.example.network project. Create an OSGI-INF folder in the org.eclipse.kura.example.network project. Add a Component Class with the parent folder org.eclipse.kura.example.network/OSGI-INF, Component Name org.eclipse.kura.example.network, and Class org.eclipse.kura.example.network.NetworkConfigExample. Select the Services tab in the component.xml file. Under Referenced Services, add org.eclipse.kura.net.NetworkAdminService . Edit the properties of this service, and configure the Bind property to setNetworkAdminService and Unbind to unsetNetworkAdminService as shown in the following screen capture. These settings are required because of the dependency on NetworkAdminService. The following source code will also need to be implemented: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF - OSGI manifest that describes the bundle and its dependencies. OSGI-INF/component.xml - declarative services definition describing what services are exposed by and consumed by this bundle. org.eclipse.kura.example.network.NetworkConfigExample.java - main implementation class.

SECURITY_WPA2 ; At this point, the bundle implementation is complete. Make sure to save all files before proceeding. Export the OSGi bundle as a stand-alone plug-in, following the instructions in Hello World Using the Kura Logger . Deploy the Bundle In order to proceed, you need to know the IP address of your embedded gateway that is running Kura. Follow the mToolkit instructions for installing a single bundle to the remote target device located here . Once the bundle has finished deploying, it will set the device\u2019s network configuration and attempt to connect to a Wi-Fi access point using the configured parameters in the connectToWirelessAccessPoint() method. Test the Connection to the Access Point To verify that the interface (wlan0) has acquired an IP address, run the ifconfig command at a terminal on the embedded gateway. To show the current connection status to the access point, run the following commands: wpa_cli -i wlan0 status iw dev wlan0 link iw dev wlan0 station dump Create an Access Point This example code can be modified slightly to make the gateway function as an access point instead of connecting to an access point. To do this, modify the activate() method in the NetworkConfigExample.java file to comment out connectToWirelessAccessPoint() and uncomment createWirelessAccessPoint() . protected void activate ( ComponentContext componentContext ) { s_logger . info ( \"Activating NetworkConfigExample...\" ); // connectToWirelessAccessPoint(); createWirelessAccessPoint (); s_logger . info ( \"Activating NetworkConfigExample... Done.\" ); } Modify the access point configuration variables under createWirelessAccessPoint() for your needs, if necessary, such as the variables: IP4Address ipAddress = ( IP4Address ) IPAddress . parseHostAddress ( \"172.16.10.1\" ); IP4Address subnetMask = ( IP4Address ) IPAddress . parseHostAddress ( \"255.255.255.0\" ); // Create a WifiConfig access point String driver = \"nl80211\" ; String ssid = \"NetworkConfigExample\" ; String password = \"password\" ; Export the bundle again as a stand-alone OSGi plug-in and redeploy it to the target device. It should now reconfigure itself to create an access point with an active DHCP server, DNS proxy forwarding, and NAT enabled. Test the Access Point To verify that the interface (wlan0) has a fixed IP address, run the ifconfig command at a terminal on the embedded gateway. To view information on the Wi-Fi access point, including interface name, wireless channel, and MAC address, enter: iw dev wlan0 info To monitor connect and disconnect events from the access point, enter: iw event \u2013f Use another wireless client, such as a laptop, to verify that you can connect to the access point, that it receives an IP address, and that it can ping the network. When the client connects to the access point, the console should show a new station connection event. To view station statistic information, including signal strength and bitrate, enter: iw dev wlan0 station dump Optionally, if the gateway has another interface configured for WAN with connection to the Internet, then the wireless client should be able to reach the Internet using this access point as its gateway. The setup for the other interface (not covered in this example) would need to be configured in the device using the Kura Gateway Administration Console .","title":"How to Manage Network Settings"},{"location":"java-application-development/how-to-manage-network-settings/#how-to-manage-network-settings","text":"This section provides an example of how to create a Kura bundle that can be used to configure the network interfaces of your device.

Typically, the device settings would be defined through the Kura Gateway Administration Console instead of through Java code. A more practical application of this example is for IP network interfaces that need to be dynamically modified based on some external trigger or condition, such as geo-fencing.

In this example, you will communicate with a simple terminal emulator to demonstrate both transmitting and receiving data. You will learn how to perform the following functions: Create a plugin that communicates to serial devices Export the bundle Install the bundle on the remote device Test the communication with minicom where, minicom is acting as an attached serial device such as an NFC reader, GPS device, or some other ASCII-based communication device Prerequisites Setting up Kura Development Environment Hello World Using the Kura Logger Hardware Use an embedded device running Kura with two available serial ports. (If the device does not have a serial port, USB to serial adapters can be used.) Ensure minicom is installed on the embedded device. Serial Communication with Kura This section of the tutorial covers setting up the hardware, determining serial port device nodes, implementing the basic serial communication bundle, deploying the bundle, and validating its functionality. After completing this section, you should be able to communicate with any ASCII-based serial device attached to a Kura-enabled embedded gateway. In this example, we are using ASCII for clarity, but these same techniques can be used to communicate with serial devices that communicate using binary protocols. Hardware Setup Your setup requirements will depend on your hardware platform. At a minimum, you will need two serial ports with a null modem serial, crossover cable connecting them. If your platform has integrated serial ports, you only need to connect them using a null modem serial cable. If you do not have integrated serial ports on your platform, you will need to purchase USB-to-Serial adapters. It is recommended to use a USB-to-Serial adapter with either the PL2303 or FTDI chipset, but others may work depending on your hardware platform and underlying Linux support. Once you have attached these adapters to your device, you can attach the null modem serial cable between the two ports. Determine Serial Device Nodes This step is hardware specific. If your hardware device has integrated serial ports, contact your hardware device manufacturer or review the documentation to find out how the ports are named in the operating system. The device identifiers should be similar to the following: /dev/ttyS*xx* /dev/ttyUSB*xx* /dev/ttyACM*xx* If you are using USB-to-Serial adapters, Linux usually allocates the associated device nodes dynamically at the time of insertion. In order to determine what they are, run the following command at a terminal on the embedded gateway: tail -f /var/log/syslog Warning Depending on your specific Linux implementation, other possible log files may be: /var/log/kern.log, /var/log/kernel, or /var/log/dmesg. With the above command running, insert your USB-to-Serial adapter. You should see output similar to the following: root@localhost:/root> tail -f /var/log/syslog Aug 15 18:43:47 localhost kernel: usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3 Aug 15 18:43:47 localhost kernel: pl2303 3-2:1.0: pl2303 converter detected Aug 15 18:43:47 localhost kernel: usb 3-2: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB10 In this example, our device is a PL2303-compatible device and is allocated a device node of \u201c/dev/ttyUSB10\u201d. While your results may differ, the key is to identify the \u201ctty\u201d device that was allocated. For the rest of this tutorial, this device will be referred to as [device_node_1], which in this example is /dev/ttyUSB10. During development, it is also important to keep in mind that these values are dynamic; therefore, from one boot to the next and one insertion to the next, these values may change. To stop \u2018tail\u2019 from running in your console, escape with \u2018 c\u2019. If you are using two USB-to-Serial adapters, repeat the above procedure for the second serial port. The resulting device node will be referred to as [device_node_2]. Implement the Bundle Now that you have two serial ports connected to each other, you are ready to implement the code.

Make sure to save all files before proceeding. Export the Bundle To build the Serial Example bundle as a stand-alone OSGi plugin, right-click the project and select Export. From the wizard, select Plug-in Development | Deployable plug-ins and fragments and click Next. The Export window appears. Under Available Plug-ins and Fragments, verify that the newly created plug-in is selected. Under Destination, select the Directory option button and use the Browse button to select an appropriate place to save the JAR file on the local file system. Info You will need to know the location where this JAR file is saved for the deployment process. Under Options, select the checkbox Use class files compiled in the workspace in addition to the checkboxes already enabled, and click Finish. Doing so will create a JAR file in the selected directory (e.g., /home/joe/myPlugins/plugins/org.eclipse.kura.example.serial_1.0.0.201410311510.jar). Deploy the Bundle In order to proceed, you need to know the IP address of your embedded gateway that is running Kura. Once you have this IP address, follow the mToolkit instructions for installing a single bundle to a remote target device (refer to section 2.03 Testing and Deploying Bundles ). Once the installation successfully completes, you should see a message from the /var/log/kura.log file indicating that the bundle was successfully installed and configured. You can also run this example with the emulator in a Linux or OS X environment as shown sample output below. Make sure that your user account has owner permission for the serial device in /dev. Validate the Bundle Next, you need to test that your bundle does indeed echo characters back by opening minicom and configuring it to use [device_node_2] that was previously determined. Open minicom using the following command at a Linux terminal on the remote gateway device: minicom -s This command opens a view similar to the following screen capture: Scroll down to Serial port setup and press . A new dialog window opens as shown below: Use the minicom menu options on the left (i.e., A, B, C, etc.) to change desired fields. Set the fields to the same values as shown in the previous screen capture except the Serial Device should match the [device_node_2] on your target device. Once this is set, press \\<ENTER> to exit from this menu. In the main configuration menu, select Exit ( do not select the option Exit from Minicom). At this point, you have successfully started minicom on the second serial port attached to your null modem cable allowing minicom to act as a serial device that can send and receive commands to your Kura bundle. You can verify this operation by typing characters and pressing . The function (specifically a \u2018\\n\u2019 character) signals to the Kura application to echo the buffered characters back to the serial device (minicom in this case). Upon startup, minicom sends an initialization string to the serial device. These characters are sent to the minicom terminal because they were echoed back by Kura listening on the port at the other end of the null modem cable. When you are done, exit minicom by pressing \u2018 a\u2019, then \u2018q\u2019, and finally \u2018 \u2019. Doing so brings you back to the Linux command prompt. This tutorial instructed you how to write and deploy a Kura bundle on your target device that listens for serial data (coming from the minicom terminal and being received on [device_node_1]). This tutorial also demonstrated that the application echoes data back to the same serial port that is received in minicom, which acts a serial device that sends and receives data. If supported by the device, Kura may send and receive binary data instead of ASCII.","title":"How to Use Serial Ports"},{"location":"java-application-development/how-to-serial-ports/#how-to-use-serial-ports","text":"","title":"How to Use Serial Ports"},{"location":"java-application-development/how-to-serial-ports/#overview","text":"This section provides an example of how to create a Kura bundle that will communicate with a serial device.

Open minicom using the following command at a Linux terminal on the remote gateway device: minicom -s This command opens a view similar to the following screen capture: Scroll down to Serial port setup and press . A new dialog window opens as shown below: Use the minicom menu options on the left (i.e., A, B, C, etc.) to change desired fields. Set the fields to the same values as shown in the previous screen capture except the Serial Device should match the [device_node_2] on your target device. Once this is set, press \\<ENTER> to exit from this menu. In the main configuration menu, select Exit ( do not select the option Exit from Minicom). At this point, you have successfully started minicom on the second serial port attached to your null modem cable allowing minicom to act as a serial device that can send and receive commands to your Kura bundle. You can verify this operation by typing characters and pressing . The function (specifically a \u2018\\n\u2019 character) signals to the Kura application to echo the buffered characters back to the serial device (minicom in this case). Upon startup, minicom sends an initialization string to the serial device. These characters are sent to the minicom terminal because they were echoed back by Kura listening on the port at the other end of the null modem cable. When you are done, exit minicom by pressing \u2018 a\u2019, then \u2018q\u2019, and finally \u2018 \u2019. Doing so brings you back to the Linux command prompt. This tutorial instructed you how to write and deploy a Kura bundle on your target device that listens for serial data (coming from the minicom terminal and being received on [device_node_1]). This tutorial also demonstrated that the application echoes data back to the same serial port that is received in minicom, which acts a serial device that sends and receives data. If supported by the device, Kura may send and receive binary data instead of ASCII.","title":"Validate the Bundle"},{"location":"java-application-development/how-to-use-can-bus/","text":"How to Use CAN bus The Kura CAN bus protocol implementation is based on the SocketCAN interface, which provides a socket interface to userspace applications.

A Beacon device is a Bluetooth Low Energy device that broadcasts its identity to nearby devices. It uses a specific BLE packet, called beacon or advertising packet, that contains the following information: Proximity UUID - a 128-bit value that uniquely identifies one or more beacons as a certain type or from a certain organization.

Tx Power - a value programmed into the beacon that enables distance from the beacon to be determined based on signal strength. The Beacon Scanner bundle is configured with a Company Code in order to filter the near beacons. So, only beacons with a specific Company Code are discovered by the bundle and their information are reported. Moreover the bundle is able to roughly estimate the distance from the beacon. For further information about the Beacons, please refer to the BLE Beacon Example . Prerequisites Development Environment Setup Hardware Embedded device running Kura with Bluetooth 4.0 (LE) capabilities. bluez_ packet must be installed on the embedded device. Follow the installation instructions in How to Use Bluetooth LE . For this tutorial a Raspberry Pi Type B with a LMTechnologies LM506 Bluetooth 4.0 dongle is used. Beacon Scanning with Kura The Beacon Scanner bundle is a Kura example that allows you to configure the Company Code for the Beacon filtering and to start/stop the scanner procedure. Develop the Beacon Scanner Bundle The Beacon Scanner bundle code development follows the guidelines presented in the Hello World Application : Create a Plug-in Project named org.eclipse.kura.example.beacon.scanner . Create the class BeaconScannerExample . Include the following bundles in the MANIFEST.MF: org.eclipse.kura.bluetooth org.eclipse.kura.configuration org.osgi.service.component org.slf4j The following files need to be implemented in order to write the source code: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF - OSGI manifest that describes the bundle and its dependencies. OSGI-INF/beaconExample.xml - declarative services definition that describes the services exposed and consumed by this bundle. OSGI-INF/metatype/org.eclipse.kura.example.beacon.scanner.BeaconScannerExample.xml - configuration description of the bundle and its parameters, types, and defaults. org.eclipse.kura.example.beacon.scanner.BeaconScannerExample.java - main implementation class. OSGI-INF/metatype/org.eclipse.kura.example.beacon.scanner.BeaconScannerExample.xml File The OSGI-INF/metatype/org.eclipse.kura.example.beacon.scanner.BeaconScannerExample.xml file describes the parameters for this bundle including the following: enableScanning - enables Beacon scanning. companyCode - defines a 16-bit company code as hex string. iname - provides the name of bluetooth adapter. org.eclipse.kura.example.beacon.scanner.BeaconScannerExample.java File The com.eurotech.example.beacon.scanner.BeaconScannerExample.java file contains the activate, deactivate and updated methods for this bundle. The activate and updated methods gets the properties from the configurable component and, if the scanning is enabled, call the setup private method. This method gets the BluetoothAdapter , enables the interface if needed, and starts the scan calling the bluetootAdapter.startBeaconScan(companyCode, listener) method. The arguments of the method are the companyCode and a listener that is notified when a device is detected. In this case the BeaconScannerExample class implements BluetoothBeaconScanListener . The following code sample shows the setup method: private void setup () { this . publishTimes = new HashMap < String , Long > (); this . bluetoothAdapter = this . bluetoothService . getBluetoothAdapter ( this . adapterName ); if ( this . bluetoothAdapter != null ) { this . bluetoothAdapter . startBeaconScan ( this . companyCode , this ); } } Since BeaconScannerExample implements BluetoothBeaconScanListener , the onBeaconDataReceived method must be overridden. When a device is detected, the listener is notified and the onBeaconDataReceived method is called with a BluetoothBeaconData object. The BluetoothBeaconData class contains the following fields: uuid - a 128-bit value that uniquely identifies one or more beacons as a certain type or from a certain organization. address - the source of the beacon major - an optional 16-bit unsigned integer that can group related beacons with the same proximity UUID. minor - an optional 16-bit unsigned integer that differentiates beacons with the same proximity UUID and major value. rssi - the Received Signal Strength Indication txpower - a value programmed into the beacon that enables distance from the beacon to be determined based on signal strength. The following code is an implementation of onBeaconDataReceived that logs the BluetoothBeaconData fields: public void onBeaconDataReceived ( BluetoothBeaconData beaconData ) { logger . debug ( \"Beacon from {} detected.\" , beaconData . address ); long now = System . nanoTime (); Long lastPublishTime = this . publishTimes . get ( beaconData . address ); // If this beacon is new, or it last published more than 'rateLimit' ms ago if ( lastPublishTime == null || ( now - lastPublishTime ) / 1000000L > this . rateLimit ) { // Store the publish time against the address this . publishTimes . put ( beaconData . address , now ); if ( this . cloudPublisher == null ) { logger . info ( \"No cloud publisher selected. Cannot publish!\" ); return ; } // Publish the beacon data to the beacon's topic KuraPayload kp = new KuraPayload (); kp . setTimestamp ( new Date ()); kp . addMetric ( \"uuid\" , beaconData . uuid ); kp . addMetric ( \"txpower\" , beaconData . txpower ); kp . addMetric ( \"rssi\" , beaconData . rssi ); kp . addMetric ( \"major\" , beaconData . major ); kp . addMetric ( \"minor\" , beaconData . minor ); kp . addMetric ( \"distance\" , calculateDistance ( beaconData . rssi , beaconData . txpower )); Map < String , Object > properties = new HashMap < String , Object > (); properties . put ( \"address\" , beaconData . address ); KuraMessage message = new KuraMessage ( kp , properties ); try { this . cloudPublisher . publish ( message ); } catch ( KuraException e ) { logger . error ( \"Unable to publish\" , e ); } } } Finally, the Beacon Scanner is able to roughly estimate the distance of the detected beacon using the calculateDistance method: private double calculateDistance ( int rssi , int txpower ) { double distance ; int ratioDB = txpower - rssi ; double ratioLinear = Math . pow ( 10 , ( double ) ratioDB / 10 ); distance = Math . sqrt ( ratioLinear ); return distance ; } Deploy and Validate the Bundle In order to proceed, you need to know the IP address of your embedded gateway that is on the remote target unit. With this information, follow the mToolkit instructions for installing a single bundle to the remote target device located here . When the installation is complete, the bundle starts automatically. In the Kura Gateway Administration Console, the BeaconScannerExample tab appears on the left and enables the device to be configured for scanning.

The advertising packet has a fixed format and is broadcasted periodically. The information contained in the advertising packet can be used by a receiver, typically a smartphone, to identify the beacon and to roughly estimate its distance. Prerequisites Development Environment Setup Hardware Embedded device running Kura with Bluetooth 4.0 (LE) capabilities. bluez_ packet must be installed on the embedded device. Follow the installation instructions in How to Use Bluetooth LE . For this tutorial a Raspberry Pi Type B with a LMTechnologies LM506 Bluetooth 4.0 dongle is used. Beacon Advertising with hcitool After the embedded device is properly configured, the advertising may be started using the hcitool command contained in the bluez packet. Plug in the Bluetooth dongle if needed and verify that the interface is up with the following command: sudo hciconfig hci0 If the interface is down, enable it with the following command: sudo hciconfig hci0 up To configure the advertising packet, enter the following command: sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 1e 02 01 1a 1a ff 4c 00 02 15 aa aa aa aa bb bb cc cc dd dd ee ee ee ee ee ee 01 00 01 00 c5 In this example, the packet will contain the uuid aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee , major 1 , minor 1 and Tx Power -59 dBm. For further information about BLE commands and packet formats, refer to the Bluetooth 4.0 Core specifications To set the advertising interval to 1 second, enter the following command: sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0006 a0 00 a0 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 00 Finally, to start the advertising, enter the following command: sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x000a 01 To verify that the embedded device is broadcasting its beacon, use a smartphone with a iBeacon scanner app (e.g., iBeacon Finder, iBeacon Scanner, or iBeaconDetector on Android). To stop the advertising, write 0 to the register 0x000a as shown in the following command: sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x000a 00 Beacon Advertising with Kura The Beacon bundle is a simple example that allows you to configure the advertising packet, the time interval, and to start/stop the advertising.

Please consider to use the new ones . Overview This section provides an example of how to develop a simple bundle that discovers and connects to a Smart device (BLE), retrieves data from it, and publishes the results to the cloud. This example uses the TI SensorTag based on CC2541 or CC2650. For more information about this device, refer to https://www.ti.com/tool/cc2541dk-sensor and https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDC-CC2650STK-SENSORTAG . You will learn how to perform the following functions: Prepare the embedded device to communicate with a Smart device Develop a bundle retrieves data from the device Optionally publish the data in the cloud Prerequisites Setting up Kura Development Environment Hardware Use an embedded device running Kura with Bluetooth 4.0 (LE) capabilities Use at least one TI SensorTag This tutorial uses a Raspberry Pi Type B with a LMTechnologies LM506 Bluetooth 4.0 dongle . Prepare the Embedded Device In order to communicate with Smart devices, the bluez package must be installed on the embedded device. To do so, make sure you have the necessary libraries on the Raspberry Pi and proceed as follows: sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev Next, download and uncompress the package: sudo wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-4.101.tar.xz sudo tar xvf bluez-4.101.tar Change to the blues folder, and then configure and install the package: cd bluez-4.101 sudo ./configure --disable-systemd --enable-tools sudo make sudo make install Finally, change the location of the hciconfig and gatttool commands: sudo mv /usr/local/sbin/hciconfig /usr/sbin sudo mv /usr/local/bin/gatttool /usr/sbin Info Both bluez 4.101 and 5.XX are supported. SensorTag Communication via Command Line Once configured, you can scan and connect with a Smart device. A TI SensorTag is used in the example that follows. Plug in the Bluetooth dongle if needed and verify that the interface is up: sudo hciconfig hci0 If the interface is down, enable it with the following command: sudo hciconfig hci0 up Perform a BLE scan with hcitool (this process may be interrupted with ctrl-c ): sudo hcitool lescan LE Scan ... BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96 ( unknown ) BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96 SensorTag If the SensorTag is not listed, press the button on the left side of the device to make it discoverable. Interactive communication with the device is possible using the gatttool: sudo gatttool -b BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96 -I [ ][ BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96 ][ LE ] > connect [ CON ][ BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96 ][ LE ] > If the output of the connect command is connect: Connection refused (111) then you have to enable LE capabilities on your BT interface: cd bluez-4.101/mgmt sudo ./btmgmt le on In order to read the sensor values from the SensorTag, you need to write some registers on the device. The example that follows shows the procedure for retrieving the temperature value from the SensorTag based on the CC2541. Once connected with gatttool, the IR temperature sensor is enabled to write the value 01 to the handle 0x0029: [CON][BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96][LE]> char-write-cmd 0x0029 01 Next, the temperature value is read from the 0x0025 handle: [CON][BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96][LE]> char-read-hnd 0x0025 [CON][BC:6A:29:AE:CC:96][LE]> Characteristic value/descriptor: a7 fe 2c 0d\", In accordance with the documentation, the retrieved raw values have to be refined in order to obtain the ambient and object temperature.

KuraPayload payload = new KuraPayload (); payload . setTimestamp ( new Date ()); payload . addMetric ( \"Firmware\" , myTiSensorTag . getFirmwareRevision ()); if ( myTiSensorTag . isCC2650 ()) { payload . addMetric ( \"Type\" , \"CC2650\" ); } else { payload . addMetric ( \"Type\" , \"CC2541\" ); } readServicesAndCharacteristics ( myTiSensorTag ); readSensors ( myTiSensorTag , payload ); myTiSensorTag . enableIOService (); publishData ( myTiSensorTag , payload ); ... } else { logger . warn ( \"Cannot connect to TI SensorTag {}.\" , myTiSensorTag . getBluetoothDevice (). getAdress ()); } }); } Since it is not possible to poll the status of the buttons on the SensorTag, the BLE example enables the notifications for them. org.eclipse.kura.example.ble.sensortag.TiSensorTag.java File The org.eclipse.kura.example.ble.sensortag.TiSensorTag class is used to connect and disconnect to the SensorTag. It also contains the methods to configure and read data from the sensor. The connection method uses the BluetoothGatt Service as shown below: public boolean connect ( String adapterName ) { this . bluetoothGatt = this . device . getBluetoothGatt (); boolean connected = false ; try { connected = this . bluetoothGatt . connect ( adapterName ); } catch ( KuraException e ) { logger . error ( e . toString ()); } if ( connected ) { this . bluetoothGatt . setBluetoothLeNotificationListener ( this ); setFirmwareRevision (); this . isConnected = true ; return true ; } else { // If connect command is not executed, close gatttool this . bluetoothGatt . disconnect (); this . isConnected = false ; return false ; } } A set of methods for reading from and writing to the internal register of the device are included in the class. The following code sample presents the methods to manage the temperature sensor. /* * Enable temperature sensor */ public void enableThermometer () { // Write \"01\" to enable thermometer sensor if ( this . cc2650 ) { this . bluetoothGatt . writeCharacteristicValue ( TiSensorTagGatt .

HANDLE_TEMP_SENSOR_PERIOD_2650 , period ); } /* * Calculate temperature */ private double [] calculateTemperature ( String value ) { logger . info ( \"Received temperature value: {}\" , value ); double [] temperatures = new double [ 2 ] ; byte [] valueByte = hexStringToByteArray ( value . replace ( \" \" , \"\" )); if ( this . cc2650 ) { int ambT = shortUnsignedAtOffset ( valueByte , 2 ); int objT = shortUnsignedAtOffset ( valueByte , 0 ); temperatures [ 0 ] = ( ambT >> 2 ) * 0.03125 ; temperatures [ 1 ] = ( objT >> 2 ) * 0.03125 ; } else { int ambT = shortUnsignedAtOffset ( valueByte , 2 ); int objT = shortSignedAtOffset ( valueByte , 0 ); temperatures [ 0 ] = ambT / 128.0 ; double vobj2 = objT ; vobj2 *= 0.00000015625 ; double tdie = ambT / 128.0 + 273.15 ; double s0 = 5.593E-14 ; // Calibration factor double a1 = 1.75E-3 ; double a2 = - 1.678E-5 ; double b0 = - 2.94E-5 ; double b1 = - 5.7E-7 ; double b2 = 4.63E-9 ; double c2 = 13.4 ; double tref = 298.15 ; double s = s0 * ( 1 + a1 * ( tdie - tref ) + a2 * Math . pow ( tdie - tref , 2 )); double vos = b0 + b1 * ( tdie - tref ) + b2 * Math . pow ( tdie - tref , 2 ); double fObj = vobj2 - vos + c2 * Math . pow ( vobj2 - vos , 2 ); double tObj = Math . pow ( Math . pow ( tdie , 4 ) + fObj / s , .25 ); temperatures [ 1 ] = tObj - 273.15 ; } return temperatures ; } The TiSensorTag class implements the org.eclipse.kura.bluetooth.BluetoothLeNotificationListener interface and the method onDataReceived is called when a BLE notification is received. In this example the notifications are used only for the buttons. The method is shown below. public void onDataReceived ( String handle , String value ) { if ( this . notificationListener != null ) { Map < String , Object > values = new HashMap <> (); if ( handle . equals ( TiSensorTagGatt . HANDLE_KEYS_STATUS_2541 ) || handle . equals ( TiSensorTagGatt .

HANDLE_TEMP_SENSOR_VALUE_2541 ) || handle . equals ( TiSensorTagGatt . HANDLE_TEMP_SENSOR_VALUE_2650 )) { double [] temperatures = calculateTemperature ( value ); values . put ( \"Ambient\" , temperatures [ 0 ] ); values . put ( \"Target\" , temperatures [ 1 ] ); this . notificationListener . notify ( this . device . getAdress (), values ); } } } Deploy and Validate the Bundle In order to proceed, you need to know the IP address of your embedded gateway that is on the remote target unit. Once you do, follow the mToolkit instructions for installing a single bundle to the remote target device located here . When the installation completes, the bundle starts automatically. You should see a message similar to the one below from /var/log/kura.log indicating that the bundle was successfully installed and configured, and started to search for TI SensorTags. 2015-11-11 13:38:19,208 [Component Resolve Thread (Bundle 6)] INFO o.e.k.e.b.t.BluetoothLe -

This service implements a subset of the Modbus Application Protocol as defined by Modbus Organization (for more information, refer to http://www.modbus.org/specs.php ). The ModbusProtocolDevice service needs to receive a valid Modbus configuration including the following parameters: Modbus protocol mode - defines the protocol mode as RTU or ASCII (only RTU mode for Ethernet connections). Timeout - sets the timeout in order to detect a disconnected device. The ModbusProtocolDevice service also requires a valid Serial Line or Ethernet connection configuration including the following parameters: Serial Line port name baudrate bits stops parity Ethernet ip address port number When a valid configuration is received, the ModbusProtocolDevice service tries to open the communication port. Serial Line communication uses the CommConnection class; Ethernet communication is based on java.net.Socket. When the communication is established, the client makes direct calls to the Modbus functions. The first parameter of each method is the Modbus address of the queried unit. This address must be in the range of 1 - 247. Function Codes The following function codes are implemented within the ModbusProtocolDevice service: 01 (0x01) readCoils(int unitAddr, int dataAddress, int count) - read 1 to 2000 maximum contiguous status of coils from the attached field device with address \"unitAddr\". An array of booleans representing the requested data points is returned. 02 (0x02) readDiscreteInputs(int unitAddr, int dataAddress, int count) - read 1 to 2000 maximum contiguous status of discrete inputs from the attached field device with address \"unitAddr\". An array of booleans representing the requested data points is returned. 03 (0x03) readHoldingRegisters(int unitAddr, int dataAddress, int count) - read contents of 1 to 125 maximum contiguous block of holding registers from the attached field device with address \"unitAddr\". An array of int representing the requested data points (data registers on 2 bytes) is returned. 04 (0x04) readInputRegisters(int unitAddr, int dataAddress, int count) - read contents of 1 to 125 maximum contiguous block of input registers from the attached field device with address \"unitAddr\".

The new APIs replace the existing Bluetooth APIs, but the old ones are still available and can be used. So, the applications developed before Kura 3.1.0 continue to work. The purpose of the new BLE Beacon APIs is to simplify the development of applications that interact with Bluetooth LE Beacon devices, offering clear and easy-to-use methods for advertising and scanning. Eclipse Kura offers out-of-the-box the implementation of the Beacon APIs for iBeacon\u2122 and Eddystone\u2122 technologies. Moreover, the new APIs allow to easily integrate new beacon implementations with Eclipse Kura. How to use Kura iBeacon\u2122 APIs This section briefly presents how to use the iBeacon\u2122 implementation of the Kura Beacon APIs, providing several code snippets to explain how to perform common operations on iBeacons. For a complete example on iBeacon advertising and scanning, please refer to the new iBeacon\u2122 advertiser and iBeacon\u2122 scanner examples. For more information about iBeacon\u2122 please refer to official page . An application that wants to use the iBeacon\u2122 implementation of Kura Beacon APIs should bind the BluetoothLeService and BluetoothLeIBeaconService OSGI services, as shown in the following Java snippet: public void setBluetoothLeService ( BluetoothLeService bluetoothLeService ) { this . bluetoothLeService = bluetoothLeService ; } public void unsetBluetoothLeService ( BluetoothLeService bluetoothLeService ) { this . bluetoothLeService = null ; } public void setBluetoothLeIBeaconService ( BluetoothLeIBeaconService bluetoothLeIBeaconService ) { this . bluetoothLeIBeaconService = bluetoothLeIBeaconService ; } public void unsetBluetoothLeIBeaconService ( BluetoothLeIBeaconService bluetoothLeIBeaconService ) { this . bluetoothLeIBeaconService = null ; } and in the component definition: <reference bind= \"setBluetoothLeService\" cardinality= \"1..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.bluetooth.le.BluetoothLeService\" name= \"BluetoothLeService\" policy= \"static\" unbind= \"unsetBluetoothLeService\" /> <reference bind= \"setBluetoothLeIBeaconService\" cardinality= \"1..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.ble.ibeacon.BluetoothLeIBeaconService\" name= \"BluetoothLeIBeaconService\" policy= \"static\" unbind= \"unsetBluetoothLeIBeaconService\" /> The BluetoothLeService is used to get the BluetoothLeAdapter to be used with the BluetoothLeIBeaconScanner and BluetoothLeIBeaconAdvertiser . As explained here , the adapter can be retrieved and powered on as follows: this . bluetoothLeAdapter = this . bluetoothLeService . getAdapter ( adapterName ); if ( this . bluetoothLeAdapter != null ) { if ( ! this . bluetoothLeAdapter . isPowered ()) { this . bluetoothLeAdapter . setPowered ( true ); } } where adapterName is the name of the adapter, e.g. hci0. Create an iBeacon\u2122 advertiser In order to properly configure an iBeacon\u2122 advertiser, a BluetoothLeIBeaconService is needed to create a new BluetoothLeIBeaconAdvertiser instance bound to a specific Bluetooth adapter: try { BluetoothLeBeaconAdvertiser < BluetoothLeIBeacon > advertiser = this . bluetoothLeIBeaconService . newBeaconAdvertiser ( this . bluetoothLeAdapter ); } catch ( KuraBluetoothBeaconAdvertiserNotAvailable e ) { logger . error ( \"Beacon Advertiser not available on {}\" , this . bluetoothLeAdapter . getInterfaceName (), e ); } Then a BluetoothLeIBeacon object should be created, containing all the information to be broadcasted. In the following snippet, the BluetoothLeIBeacon object is instantiated and added to the advertiser. Then the broadcast time interval is set and the beacon advertising is started. try { BluetoothLeIBeacon iBeacon = new BluetoothLeIBeacon ( uuid , major , minor , txPower ); advertiser . updateBeaconAdvertisingData ( iBeacon ); advertiser . updateBeaconAdvertisingInterval ( minInterval , maxInterval ; advertiser . startBeaconAdvertising (); } catch ( KuraBluetoothCommandException e ) { logger . error ( \"IBeacon configuration failed\" , e ); } The BluetoothLeIBeacon represents the beacon packet that will be broadcasted by the advertiser and it should be configured will the following parameters: uuid a unique number that identifies the beacon. major a number that identifies a subset of beacons within a large group. minor a number that identifies a specific beacon. txPower the transmitter power level indicating the signal strength one meter from the device. Warning Only one advertising packet can be broadcasted at a time on a specific Bluetooth adapter. Finally, in the following snippet the advertiser is stopped and removed from the BluetoothLeIBeaconService : try { advertiser . stopBeaconAdvertising (); this . bluetoothLeIBeaconService . deleteBeaconAdvertiser ( advertiser ); } catch ( KuraBluetoothCommandException e ) { logger . error ( \"Stop iBeacon advertising failed\" , e ); } Create an iBeacon\u2122 scanner As done for the advertiser , a BluetoothLeIBeaconService is needed to create a new BluetoothLeIBeaconScanner instance bound to a specific Bluetooth adapter: bluetoothLeBeaconScanner < BluetoothLeIBeacon > scanner = this . bluetoothLeIBeaconService . newBeaconScanner ( this . bluetoothLeAdapter ); A BluetoothLeIBeaconScanner needs a listener to collect the iBeacon packets that the Bluetooth adapter detects. In the following snippet, a simple listener that prints the iBeacon packet configuration is added to the scanner object: private class iBeaconListener implements BluetoothLeBeaconListener < BluetoothLeIBeacon > { @Override public void onBeaconsReceived ( BluetoothLeIBeacon beacon ) { logger . info ( \"iBeacon received from {}\" , beacon . getAddress ()); logger . info ( \"UUID : {}\" , beacon . getUuid ()); logger . info ( \"Major : {}\" , beacon . getMajor ()); logger . info ( \"Minor : {}\" , beacon . getMinor ()); logger . info ( \"TxPower : {}\" , beacon . getTxPower ()); logger . info ( \"RSSI : {}\" , beacon . getRssi ()); } } scanner . addBeaconListener ( listener ); The scanner is started for a specific time interval (in this case 10 seconds): scanner . startBeaconScan ( 10 ); Finally the scanner should be stopped, if needed, and the resources are released: if ( scanner . isScanning ()) { scanner . stopBeaconScan (); } scanner . removeBeaconListener ( listener ); this . bluetoothLeIBeaconService . deleteBeaconScanner ( scanner ); Note The kura.legacy.bluetooth.beacon.scan property in the kura.properties file defines how the scan for beacons is performed. If set to true , the deprecated hcitool command is used. This guarantees that all the advertisement packets are reported. If set to false , the library will communicate to the OS using dbus. In the latter case, the rate of reports is limited and not all the advertisement packets are reported. How to use Kura Eddystone\u2122 APIs Eddystone\u2122 is a protocol specification that defines a BLE message format for proximity beacon messages. It describes several different frame types that may be used individually or in combinations to create beacons that can be used for a variety of applications. For more information please see here and here . In this section the Eddystone\u2122 implementation of the Kura Beacon APIs is presented, providing several code snippets to explain how to perform common operations on them. For a complete example on Eddystone\u2122 advertising and scanning, please refer to the new Eddystone\u2122 advertiser and Eddystone\u2122 scanner examples.

Currently, UID and URL frame types are supported. A UID frame can be created as follows: BluetoothLeEddystone eddystone = new BluetoothLeEddystone (); eddystone . configureEddystoneUIDFrame ( namespace , instance , txPower ); where namespace and instance are respectively 10-byte and 6-byte long sequences that compose a unique 16-byte Beacon ID.

After the BluetoothLeEddystone creation, the packet is added to the advertiser and the broadcast time interval is set. Then the advertiser is started: try { advertiser . updateBeaconAdvertisingData ( eddystone ); advertiser . updateBeaconAdvertisingInterval ( this . options . getMinInterval (), this . options . getMaxInterval ()); advertiserstartBeaconAdvertising (); } catch ( KuraBluetoothCommandException e ) { logger . error ( \"Eddystone configuration failed\" , e ); } Finally, in the following snippet the advertiser is stopped and removed from the BluetoothLeEddystoneService : try { advertiser . stopBeaconAdvertising (); this . bluetoothLeEddystoneService . deleteBeaconAdvertiser ( advertiser ); } catch ( KuraBluetoothCommandException e ) { logger . error ( \"Stop Advertiser advertising failed\" , e ); } Create an Eddystone\u2122 scanner As done for the advertiser , a BluetoothLeEddystoneService is needed to create a new BluetoothLeEddystoneScanner instance bound to a specific Bluetooth adapter: bluetoothLeBeaconScanner < BluetoothLeEddystone > scanner = this . bluetoothLeEddystoneService . newBeaconScanner ( this . bluetoothLeAdapter ); A BluetoothLeEddystoneScanner needs a listener to collect the Eddystone packets that the Bluetooth adapter detects.

In the latter case, the rate of reports is limited and not all the advertisement packets are reported. Add new Beacon APIs implementation Eclipse Kura offers the implementation for iBeacon\u2122 and Eddystone\u2122 protocols, but it is possible to add implementations of different kinds of beacon protocols. The org.eclipse.kura.bluetooth.le.beacon package contains the interfaces used by the beacon implementations: BluetoothLeBeaconService is the entry point for applications that want to use the Beacon APIs. BluetoothLeBeaconManager is used by the BluetoothLeBeaconService and provides methods to create and delete Beacon advertisers and scanners. BluetoothLeBeaconAdvertiser allows configuring advertisement packets and managing advertising. BluetoothLeBeaconScanner is used to search for specific Beacon packets. BluetoothLeBeaconEncoder implements methods for encoding a Beacon object to a stream of bytes. BluetoothLeBeaconDecoder implements methods for decoding a stream of bytes in to a Beacon object. BluetoothLeBeacon represents a generic Beacon packet. The BluetoothLeBeaconManager , BluetoothLeBeaconScanner and BluetoothLeBeaconAdvertiser interfaces handles generic BluetoothLeBeacon objects and their implementations are provided by the org.eclipse.kura.ble.provider . The others interfaces, instead, are Beacon specific and their implementations depend on the specific protocol that is used. As a consequence, who wants to support a new Beacon protocol, should provide the implementation of the BluetoothLeBeaconService , BluetoothLeBeaconEncoder and BluetoothLeBeaconDecoder interfaces and extend the BluetoothLeBeacon class. As an example, the org.eclipse.kura.ble.ibeacon.provider provides the implementation of the above APIs for the iBeacon\u2122 protocol. In this case, the org.eclipse.kura.ble.ibeacon package contains the following: BluetoothLeIBeacon implements the BluetoothLeBeacon interface for the iBeacon\u2122 packet. BluetoothLeIBeaconEncoder is a marker interface that extends BluetoothLeBeaconEncoder . BluetoothLeIBeaconDecoder is a marker interface that extends BluetoothLeBeaconDecoder . BluetoothLeIBeaconService is a marker interface that extends BluetoothLeBeaconService and is the entry point for applications that wants to use an iBeacon\u2122. The org.eclipse.kura.internal.ble.ibeacon provides the implementations for the above interfaces: BluetoothLeIBeaconEncoderImpl implements BluetoothLeIBeaconEncoder offering a method to encode the BluetoothLeIBeacon into a byte stream. BluetoothLeIBeaconDecoderImpl implements BluetoothLeIBeaconDecoder offering a method to decode a stream of bytes into a BluetoothLeIBeacon object. BluetoothLeIBeaconServiceImpl is the implementation of BluetoothLeIBeaconService and uses the generic BluetoothLeBeaconManager service to create scanners and advertisers.

The org.eclipse.kura.bluetooth.le.beacon package contains the interfaces used by the beacon implementations: BluetoothLeBeaconService is the entry point for applications that want to use the Beacon APIs. BluetoothLeBeaconManager is used by the BluetoothLeBeaconService and provides methods to create and delete Beacon advertisers and scanners. BluetoothLeBeaconAdvertiser allows configuring advertisement packets and managing advertising. BluetoothLeBeaconScanner is used to search for specific Beacon packets. BluetoothLeBeaconEncoder implements methods for encoding a Beacon object to a stream of bytes. BluetoothLeBeaconDecoder implements methods for decoding a stream of bytes in to a Beacon object. BluetoothLeBeacon represents a generic Beacon packet. The BluetoothLeBeaconManager , BluetoothLeBeaconScanner and BluetoothLeBeaconAdvertiser interfaces handles generic BluetoothLeBeacon objects and their implementations are provided by the org.eclipse.kura.ble.provider . The others interfaces, instead, are Beacon specific and their implementations depend on the specific protocol that is used. As a consequence, who wants to support a new Beacon protocol, should provide the implementation of the BluetoothLeBeaconService , BluetoothLeBeaconEncoder and BluetoothLeBeaconDecoder interfaces and extend the BluetoothLeBeacon class. As an example, the org.eclipse.kura.ble.ibeacon.provider provides the implementation of the above APIs for the iBeacon\u2122 protocol. In this case, the org.eclipse.kura.ble.ibeacon package contains the following: BluetoothLeIBeacon implements the BluetoothLeBeacon interface for the iBeacon\u2122 packet. BluetoothLeIBeaconEncoder is a marker interface that extends BluetoothLeBeaconEncoder . BluetoothLeIBeaconDecoder is a marker interface that extends BluetoothLeBeaconDecoder . BluetoothLeIBeaconService is a marker interface that extends BluetoothLeBeaconService and is the entry point for applications that wants to use an iBeacon\u2122. The org.eclipse.kura.internal.ble.ibeacon provides the implementations for the above interfaces: BluetoothLeIBeaconEncoderImpl implements BluetoothLeIBeaconEncoder offering a method to encode the BluetoothLeIBeacon into a byte stream. BluetoothLeIBeaconDecoderImpl implements BluetoothLeIBeaconDecoder offering a method to decode a stream of bytes into a BluetoothLeIBeacon object.

The new APIs replace the existing Bluetooth APIs, but the old ones are still available and can be used. So, the applications developed before Kura 3.1.0 continue to work. The purpose of the new BLE APIs is to simplify the development of applications that interact with Bluetooth LE devices, offering clear and easy-to-use methods, and add new features to correctly manage the connection with remote devices. Moreover, the APIs organize the methods in a logical way to access all levels of a GATT client, from GATT services to GATT characteristics and descriptors, using UUIDs to identify the correct resource. Bluez-Dbus - BLE GATT API The implementation of the new Kura BLE APIs is based on the Bluez-Dbus library that provides an easy to use Bluetooth LE API based on BlueZ over DBus. The library eases the access to GATT services and the management of BLE connections and discovery, without using any wrapper library as it is based on a newer version of dbus-java which uses jnr-unixsocket. APIs description The new BLE APIs are exported in the org.eclipse.kura.bluetooth.le package. The interfaces are briefly described in the following. BluetoothLeService is the entry point of the OSGI service. It allows to get all the Bluetooth interfaces installed on the gateway or a specific one using the name of the adapter. BluetoothLeAdapter represents the physical Bluetooth adapter on the gateway. It allows to start/stop a discovery, search a specific BLE device based on the BD address, power up/down the adapter and get information about the adapter. BluetoothLeDevice represents a Bluetooth LE device. The interface provides methods for connections and disconnections, list the GATT services or search a specific one based on the UUID and get generic information about the device. BluetoothLeGattService represents a GATT service and allows listing the GATT characteristics provided by the device. BluetoothLeGattCharacteristic represents a GATT characteristic. It provides methods to read from and write to the characteristic, enable or disable notifications and get the properties. BluetoothLeGattDescriptor represents a GATT descriptor associated with the characteristic. More information about the APIs can be found in API Reference . How to use the Kura BLE API This section briefly presents how to use the Kura BLE APIs, providing several code snippets to explain how to perform common bluetooth operations. For a complete example, please refer to the new SensorTag application . An application that wants to use the Kura BLE APIs should bind the BluetoothLeService OSGI service, as shown in the following Java snippet: public void setBluetoothLeService ( BluetoothLeService bluetoothLeService ) { this . bluetoothLeService = bluetoothLeService ; } public void unsetBluetoothLeService ( BluetoothLeService bluetoothLeService ) { this . bluetoothLeService = null ; } and in the component definition: <reference bind= \"setBluetoothLeService\" cardinality= \"1..1\" interface= \"org.eclipse.kura.bluetooth.le.BluetoothLeService\" name= \"BluetoothLeService\" policy= \"static\" unbind= \"unsetBluetoothLeService\" /> Get the Bluetooth adapter Once bound to the BluetoothLeService , an application can get the Bluetooth adapter and power on it, if needed: this . bluetoothLeAdapter = this . bluetoothLeService . getAdapter ( adapterName ); if ( this . bluetoothLeAdapter != null ) { if ( ! this . bluetoothLeAdapter . isPowered ()) { this . bluetoothLeAdapter . setPowered ( true ); } } where adapterName is the name of the adapter, i.e. hci0. Search for BLE devices The BluetoothLeAdapter provides several methods to search for a device, a.k.a. perform a BLE discovery: Future<BluetoothLeDevice> findDeviceByAddress(long timeout, String address) search for a BLE device with the specified address. The method will perform a BLE discovery for at most timeout seconds or until the device is found. It will return a Future instance and the discovered device can be retrieved using the get() method. Future<BluetoothLeDevice> findDeviceByName(long timeout, String name) search for a BLE device with the specified system name and return a Future. void findDeviceByAddress(long timeout, String address, Consumer<BluetoothLeDevice> consumer) search for a BLE device with the specified address. The method will perform a BLE discovery for at most timeout seconds or until the device is found. When the device is found or the timeout is reached the consumer is used to get the device. void findDeviceByAddress(long timeout, String address, Consumer<BluetoothLeDevice> consumer) search for a BLE device with the specified name and use the provided consumer to return the device. Future<List<BluetoothLeDevice>> findDevices(long timeout) and void findDevices(long timeout, Consumer<List<BluetoothLeDevice>> consumer) are similar to the methods above, but they get a list of Bluetooth devices. The following snippet shows how to perform a discovery of 10 seconds using findDevices method: if ( this . bluetoothLeAdapter . isDiscovering ()) { try { this . bluetoothLeAdapter . stopDiscovery (); } catch ( KuraException e ) { logger . error ( \"Failed to stop discovery\" , e ); } } Future < List < BluetoothLeDevice >> future = this . bluetoothLeAdapter . findDevices ( 10 ); try { List < BluetoothLeDevice > ; devices = future . get (); } catch ( InterruptedException | ExecutionException e ) { logger . error ( \"Scan for devices failed\" , e ); } Get the GATT services and characteristics To get the GATT services using the BluetoothLeDevice , use the following snippet: try { List < BluetoothLeGattService > ; services = device . findServices (); } catch ( KuraBluetoothResourceNotFoundException e ) { logger . error ( \"Unable to find GATT services\" , e ); } A specific GATT service can be retrieved using its UUID: try { BluetoothLeGattService service = device . findService ( uuid ); } catch ( KuraBluetoothResourceNotFoundException e ) { logger . error ( \"Unable to find GATT service\" , e ); } Using the GATT service, it is possible to get a specific GATT characteristic (or the complete list) and the GATT descriptor from it: try { BluetoothLeGattCharacteristic characteristic = service . findCharacteristic ( characteristicUuid ); BluetoothLeGattDescriptor descriptor = characteristic . findDescriptor ( descriptorUuid ); } catch ( KuraBluetoothResourceNotFoundException e ) { logger . error ( \"Unable to find GATT resources\" , e ); } IO operations on GATT characteristics and descriptors The Kura BLE APIs provides methods to manage the IO operations on GATT characteristics and descriptors. The following snippet provides an example on how to read and write data to a characteristic. try { byte [] valueRead = characteristic . readValue (); byte [] valueWrite = { 0x01 }; characteristic . writeValue ( valueWrite ); } catch ( KuraBluetoothIOException e ) { logger . error ( \"IO operation failed\" , e ); } In the following example, instead, a notification listener is configured to periodically receive the data from a GATT characteristic and print the first value of the given array. The period is internally set by the BLE device. try { Consumer < byte []> ; callback = valueBytes -> System . out . println (( int ) valueBytes [ 0 ] ); characteristic . enableValueNotifications ( callback ); } catch ( KuraBluetoothNotificationException e ) { logger . error (); } Configure Bluez on the Raspberry Pi The minimum version of Bluez supported by Kura Bluetooth LE APIs is 5.42.

Since RAM usage is application dependent, it is important to perform some stress tests to bring the device in the worst case conditions and verify system behavior. Some of the aspects that should be taken into account are the following: Java Heap memory usage Java heap is used to store the Java objects and classes at runtime. The heap should be: Large enough to satisfy the requirements of applications running inside Kura. Small enough so that the requirements of the system and applications running outside Kura are satisfied. The size of the heap is controlled by the -Xms and -Xmx Java command line arguments. These parameters are defined in the /opt/eclipse/kura/bin/start_kura_debug.sh (for development mode) and /opt/eclipse/kura/bin/start_kura_background.sh (for production mode). The -Xms parameter defines the initial size of Java heap and -Xmx defines the maximum size. The JVM will start using Xms as the size of the heap, and then it will grow the heap at runtime up to Xmx if needed, depending on application memory demand. Resizing the heap has a cost in terms of performance, for this reason Xms and Xmx are set to the same size by default on most platforms. In order to understand if the heap is large enough, it is advisable to perform a stress test simulating the conditions of maximum memory demand by the applications running inside Kura. For example, if a in-memory database instance is used by a DataService instance, during the test the database can be filled up to the maximum capacity to verify if this causes any issue. Regarding point 2., it should be noted that heap memory is not necessarily backed by physical memory immediately after JVM startup. Even if the JVM performs an allocation of size Xmx immediately, physical memory will be assigned to the Java process by the kernel only when the memory pages are actually accessed by the JVM. For this reason the amount of physical memory used by the JVM might appear small right after system boot and grow with time, up to the maximum size. This can happen even if the applications running inside Kura do not have high memory requirements, and can lead to potential issues that show up only after some time. In order to recreate such issues, the -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch JVM command line option can be used during development to force the JVM to access all heap memory after start, causing the JVM process to use the maximum amount of physical memory immediately. Logging Another aspect that can lead to RAM related issues is logging. As a general rule, it is recommended to reduce the amount of log messages produced by Kura during normal operation. Kura default logging configuration ( /opt/eclipse/kura/log4j/log4j.xml ) depends on the platform. The size of the files in the /var/log directory will be checked periodically and the files will be rotated to the persisted /var/old_logs directory if needed. External application RAM usage If external applications are installed on the system (e.g. Docker containers), their RAM usage should be analyzed as well.

This can happen even if the applications running inside Kura do not have high memory requirements, and can lead to potential issues that show up only after some time. In order to recreate such issues, the -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch JVM command line option can be used during development to force the JVM to access all heap memory after start, causing the JVM process to use the maximum amount of physical memory immediately.","title":"Java Heap memory usage"},{"location":"java-application-development/ram-usage-considerations/#logging","text":"Another aspect that can lead to RAM related issues is logging.

An Asset used in this way is called WireAsset . Read mode Every time a WireAsset receives an envelope on its input port, it will read the values of all of its channels with READ or READ_WRITE type. The result is emitted as a WireEnvelope with a single WireRecord. The WireRecord contains the following properties: a property with key assetName , value type STRING and the emitting asset asset name as value For each channel in asset configuration with READ or READ_WRITE type named name : a property with key = name , value type = value.type in channel configuration and value = value obtained from read operation. This property will be present only if the read operation is successful. a property with key = <name>_timestamp value type = LONG reporting a timestamp in milliseconds since UNIX epoch. This property will be present only if the timestamp.mode Asset configuration property is set to PER_CHANNEL a property with key = <name>_error , value type = STRING reporting an error message. This property will be present only if read operation fails and the emit.errors Asset configuration property is set to true. For example, if the Asset attached to the Modbus Driver shown in the picture below receives a WireEnvelope on its input port, it can emit an envelope with the following content, assuming that the read operation for each channel succeed: WireEnvelope WireRecord[0] assetName : modbusAsset (type = STRING ) LED1 : true (type = BOOLEAN ) LED1_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) LED2 : false (type = BOOLEAN ) LED2_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) LED3 : true (type = BOOLEAN ) LED3_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) LED4-RED : false (type = BOOLEAN ) LED4-RED_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) LED4-GREEN : false (type = BOOLEAN ) LED4-GREEN_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) LED4-BLUE : true (type = BOOLEAN ) LED4-BLUE_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) Toggle-4 : true (type = BOOLEAN ) Toggle-4_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) Toggle-5 : false (type = BOOLEAN ) Toggle-5_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) Toggle-6 : true (type = BOOLEAN ) Toggle-6_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) Counter-3 : 123 (type = INTEGER ) Counter-3_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) Quad-Counter : 11 (type = INTEGER ) Quad-Counter_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) Reset-Counter3 : false (type = BOOLEAN ) Reset-Counter3_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) Reset-Quad-Counter : false (type = BOOLEAN ) Reset-Quad-Counter_timestamp : 1597925188 (type = LONG ) The emitted WireEnvelope contains a single record containing the properties described above. The Logger WireComponent can be used to inspect the messages emitted on a specific output port of a WireComponent by creating a connection between the output port of the component to the input port of the Logger. In this case the content of the received envelopes will be printed on device log ( /var/log/kura.log ). As mentioned above, the read operation is performed only if an envelope is received on the input port of the WireAsset. In order to achieve this, another component must be connected to the input port of the WireAsset. An example of such component can be the Timer , this component can be configured to periodically emit an envelope containing a single wire record with a single property named TIMER reporting the current UNIX timestamp. Connecting this component to a WireAsset allows to implement a simple read polling cycle. The configuration of the timer defines the polling interval. Listen mode Enabling the listen flag allows to enable unsolicited notifications from the driver. When this happens, the Asset will emit an WireEnvelope containing the updated value for the channel involved in the event. The content of this envelope is the same as the one generated in case of a read operation on the channel. For example if listen is ticked for LED1 and the driver above detects a value change in that channel, the Asset will emit the following envelope: WireEnvelope WireRecord[0] assetName : modbusAsset (type = STRING ) LED1 : false (type = BOOLEAN ) LED1_timestamp : 1597925200 (type = LONG ) This mode does not require to connect any component to the input port of the driver. The conditions that trigger the events for the channels and their meaning is reported in the Driver specific documentation. Note: The example above is not completely realistic since the Modbus driver does not support listen mode. In this case ticking the listen flag will have no effect. The support for listen mode is mentioned in driver documentation. Listen mode and Read mode are not mutually exclusive. If a channel is defined as READ or READ_WRITE and the listen flag is ticked, the driver will emit the channel value when a WireEnvelope is received on its input port or when a driver event is generated. Write mode Additionally, the Wire Graph can also be used to update asset values through write operations, according to the following rule. Every time a WireAsset receives an envelope on its input port, for each property contained in the received WireRecords with key <key> , value type <value type> and value <value> , the driver will perform this operation: If a channel with name <key> is defined in asset configuration whose value.type is equal to <value type> and type is WRITE or READ_WRITE , then the Asset will write <value> to the channel. For example if the Asset above receives the following envelope: WireEnvelope WireRecord[0] LED1 : false (type = BOOLEAN ) LED2 : 78 (type = LONG ) Toggle-4 : true (type = BOOLEAN ) foo : bar (type = STRING ) The following operations will happen: Since the Asset configuration contains a channel named LED1 , with value.type = BOOLEAN , and type = READ_WRITE , the driver will write false to that channel for the rule mentioned above. The LED2 : 78 property will have no effect, since the Asset configuration contains a channel named LED2 with type = READ_WRITE , but value.type = BOOLEAN != LONG . The Toggle-4 : true property will have no effect, since the asset contains a channel named Toggle-4 , with value.type = BOOLEAN but type = READ != WRITE | READ_WRITE The foo : bar property will have no effect, since none of the defined channels has foo as name .

The request handler also supports creating, updating and deleting Asset and Driver instances and retrieving the metadata required for supporting Wire Graph editing applications. The GET/graph/shapshot and PUT/graph/snapshot requests use the same format as the Wire Graph snapshot functionality of the Kura Web UI. A Wire Graph snapshot can be obtained by navigating to the Wires section of Kura Web UI, clicking the Download button and selecting the JSON format. Accessing the REST APIs requires to use an identity with the rest.wires.admin permission assigned.

The operation ids are the following: updateGraph for the graph update operation, update:$pid or delete:$pid for update or delete operations performed on configurations not referenced by the Wire Graph, and snapshot , for the snapshot creation operation. In case of an unexpected failure, a generic error response will be returned. response body : Variants : object GenericFailureReport object BatchFailureReport This request will replace the current graph topology with the received one. The received configuration must satisfy the following requirements. If any of the requirements is not met, the operation will fail and no changes will be applied to the system: * The configuration of the org.eclipse.kura.wire.graph.WireGraphService component must be specified. * The configuration of the org.eclipse.kura.wire.graph.WireGraphService component must contain a property named WireGraph of STRING type containing the graph layout as described in the WireGraphService document. * The inputPortCount and outputPortCount properties must be specified for all components in WireGraphService configuration. * The configuration of all components referenced by WireGraphService configuration that do not exist on target device must be specified. * The configuration of all components referenced by WireGraphService configuration that do not exist on target device must specify the service.factoryPid configuration property reporting the component factory pid. If a component already exists on the system and its configuration is supplied as part of the request, the component configuration will be updated. In this case the usual configuration merge semantics will be applied, the set of received properties will be merged with the existing one. The properties in the request body will overwrite the existing ones with the same name. WireAsset configurations are treated sligtly differently, an update to a WireAsset configuration is performed by deleting the existing component and creating a new instance with the received configuration. This behavior is necessary in order to allow channel removal. It is also allowed to specify Driver or Asset configurations that are not referenced by the Wire Graph included in the request body.

The current Wires threading model allows any component to perform potentially blocking operations when a wire envelope is received. The fact that the wire envelopes are delivered synchronously implies that if a wire component performs blocking operations, other components in the same subgraph might be blocked as well, introducing delays in the processing of the graph. The FIFO component can be used for decoupling blocking or slow wire components from other parts of the graph that cannot tolerate delays. In the graph above, the NODELAY component cannot tolerate potential delays introduced by the DB component, adding a FIFO component allows to decouple the two components. This component implements a FIFO queue that operates as follows: The received envelopes are added to the queue. Adding an envelope to the queue is usually (see below) a non-blocking operation. A dedicated thread pops the envelopes from the queue and delivers them to downstream components. In this way, the threads running the upstream components are not affected by blocking operations performed by the downstream components. In the example above there will be two threads that manage the processing of the graph: A thread from the TIMER Quartz scheduler pool handles the processing for the NODELAY component and submits the envelopes produced by it to the queue of the FIFO component. A second thread introduced by the FIFO component pops the received envelopes from the queue and dispatches them to the DB component, performing the processing required by it. In this way, the NODELAY and DB components are decoupled because they are managed by different threads. Configuration The FIFO component configuration is composed of the following properties: queue.capacity : The size of the queue in terms of the number of storable wire envelopes. discard.envelopes : Configures the behavior of the component in case of a full queue. If set to true , envelopes received when the queue is full will be dropped. In this mode, submitting an envelope to the queue is always a non-blocking operation. It should be used if occasionally losing wire envelopes is acceptable for the application, but introducing delays for upstream components is not. If set to false , adding an envelope when the queue is full will block the submitting thread until there is space in the queue. Submitting an envelope to the FIFO component can be a blocking operation if the queue is full. This mode should be used if dropping wire envelopes is unacceptable for upstream components. The probability of dropping envelopes in discard.envelopes=true mode or the probability of blocking upstream components in discard.envelopes=false mode can be controlled by setting a proper queue size.","title":"FIFO Component"},{"location":"kura-wires/single-port-wire-components/fifo-component/#fifo-component","text":"This page describes the usage of the FIFO component in Wires.

In the script window write the following code: var record = input . records [ 0 ] if ( record . ibeacon != null ) { var values = record . ibeacon . getValue (). split ( \";\" ) if ( values . length == 6 ) { var outRecord = newWireRecord () outRecord . uuid = newStringValue ( values [ 0 ]) outRecord . txPower = newIntegerValue ( parseInt ( values [ 1 ])) outRecord . rssi = newIntegerValue ( parseInt ( values [ 2 ])) outRecord . major = newIntegerValue ( parseInt ( values [ 3 ])) outRecord . minor = newIntegerValue ( parseInt ( values [ 4 ])) outRecord . distance = newDoubleValue ( parseFloat ( values [ 5 ])) output . add ( outRecord ) } } Add \"Logger\" component and set the log.verbosity to VERBOSE Connect the \"Asset\" to the \"Filter\" and this to the \"Logger\". Click on \"Apply\". Using this graph, every iBeacon packet will be detected and reported to the log, as shown below. To simulate an iBeacon device, it is possible to use another gateway with the iBeacon advertiser example .

Interactions may be solicited by a remote server to the gateway using a request/response messaging model, or unsolicited when the gateway simply reports messages or events to a remote server based on periodic or event-driven patterns. The table below defines some basic terms used in this document: Term Description account_name Identifies a group of devices and users. It can be seen as partition of the MQTT topic namespace. For example, access control lists can be defined so that users are only given access to the child topics of a given account_name . client_id Identifies a single gateway device within an account (typically the MAC address of a gateway\u2019s primary network interface). The client_id maps to the Client Identifier (Client ID) as defined in the MQTT specifications. app_id Unique string identifier for application (e.g., \u201cCONF-V1\u201d, \u201cCONF-V2\u201d, etc.). resource_id Identifies a resource(s) that is owned and managed by a particular application. Management of resources (e.g., sensors, actuators, local files, or configuration options) includes listing them, reading the latest value, or updating them to a new value. A resource_id may be a hierarchical topic, where, for example, \u201csensors/temp\u201d may identify a temperature sensor and \u201csensor/hum\u201d a humidity sensor. A gateway, as identified by a specific client_id and belonging to a particular account_name , may have one or more applications running on it (e.g., \u201capp_id1\u201d, \u201capp_id2\u201d, etc.). Each application can manage one or more resources identified by a distinct resource_id (s). Based on this criterion, an IoT application running on an IoT gateway may be viewed in terms of the resources it owns and manages as well as the unsolicited events it reports. MQTT Request/Response Conversations Solicited interactions require a request/response message pattern to be established over MQTT. To initiate a solicited conversation, a remote server first sends a request message to a given application running on a specific device and then waits for a response. To ensure the delivery of request messages, applications that support request/response conversations via MQTT should subscribe to the following topic on startup: $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/# The $EDC prefix is used to mark topics that are used as control topics for remote management. This prefix distinguishes control topics from data topics that are used in unsolicited reports and marks the associated messages as transient (not to be stored in the historical data archive, if present). Note While Kura currently requires \u201c$EDC\u201d as the prefix for control topics, this prefix may change in the future for the following reasons: MQTT 3.1.1 discourages the use of topic starting with \u201c$\u201d for application purposes. As a binding of LWM2M over MQTT is taking shape, it would make sense to use a topic prefix for management messages like \u201cLWM2M\u201d or similar abbreviations (e.g. \"LW2\u201d, \u201cLWM\u201d). A requester (i.e., the remote server) initiates a request/response conversation through the following events: Generating a conversation identifier known as a request.id (e.g., by concatenating a random number to a timestamp) Subscribing to the topic where the response message will be published, where requester.client.id is the client ID of the requester, such as: $EDC/account_name/requester.client.id/app_id/REPLY/request.id Sending the request message to the appropriate application-specific topic with the following fields in the payload: request.id (identifier used to match a response with a request) requester.client.id (client ID of the requester) The application receives the request, processes it, and responds on a REPLY topic structured as: $EDC/account_name/requester.client.id/app_id/REPLY/request.id Note While this recommendation does not mandate the format of the message payload, which is application-specific, it is important that the request.id and requester.client.id fields are included in the payload. Kura leverages an MQTT payload encoded through Google Protocol Buffers. Kura includes the request.id and the requester.client.id as two named metrics of the Request messages. The Kura payload definition can be found here . Once the response for a given request is received, the requester unsubscribes from the REPLY topic. MQTT Request/Response Example The following sample request/response conversation shows the device configuration being provided for an application: account_name: guest device client_id: F0:D2:F1:C4:53:DB app_id: CONF-V1 Remote Service Requester client_id: 00:E0:C7:01:02:03 The remote server publishes a request message similar to the following: Request Topic: $EDC/guest/F0:D2:F1:C4:53:DB/CONF-V1/GET/configurations Request Payload: request.id: 1363603920892-8078887174204257595 requester.client.id: 00:E0:C7:01:02:03 The gateway device replies with a response message similar to the following: Response Topic: $EDC/guest/00:E0:C7:01:02:03/CONF-V1/REPLY/1363603920892-8078887174204257595 Response Payload, where the following properties are mandatory: response.code Possible response code values include: 200 (RESPONSE_CODE_OK) 400 (RESPONSE_CODE_BAD_REQUEST) 404 (RESPONSE_CODE_NOTFOUND) 500 (RESPONSE_CODE_ERROR) response.exception.message (value is null or an exception message) response.exception.message (value is null or an exception stack trace) Note In addition to the mandatory properties, the response payload may also have custom properties whose description is beyond the scope of this document. It is recommended that the requester server employs a timeout to control the length of time that it waits for a response from the gateway device. If a response is not received within the timeout interval, the server can expect that either the device or the application is offline. MQTT Remote Resource Management A remote server interacts with the application\u2019s resources through read , create and update , delete, and execute operations. These operations are based on the previously described request/response conversations. Read Resources An MQTT message published on the following topic is a read request for the resource identified by the resource_id : $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/GET/resource_id The receiving application responds with a REPLY message containing the latest value of the requested resource. The resource_id is application specific and may be a hierarchical topic. It is recommended to design resource identifiers following the best practices established for REST API. For example, if an application is managing a set of sensors, a read request issued to the topic \" $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/GET/sensors \" will reply with the latest values for all sensors. Similarly, a read request issued to the topic \" $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/GET/sensors/temp \" will reply with the latest value for only a temperature sensor that is being managed by the application. Create or Update Resources An MQTT message published on the following topic is a create or update request for the resource identified by the resource_id : $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/PUT/resource_id The receiving application creates the specified resource (or updates it if it already exists) with the value supplied in the message payload and responds with a REPLY message. As in the read operations, the resource_id is application specific and may be a hierarchical topic. It is recommended to design resource identifiers following the best practices established for REST API. For example, to set the value for an actuator, a message can be published to the topic \" $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/PUT/actuator/1 \" with the new value suplliied in the message payload. Delete Resources An MQTT message published on the following topic is a delete request for the resource identified by the resource_id : $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/DEL/resource_id The receiving application deletes the specified resource, if it exists, and responds with a REPLY message. Execute Resources An MQTT message published on the following topic is an execute request for the resource identified by the resource_id : $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/EXEC/resource_id The receiving application executes the specified resource, if it exists, and responds with a REPLY message. The semantics of the execute operation is application specific. Other Operations The IoT application may respond to certain commands, such as taking a snapshot of its configuration or executing an OS-level command. The following topic namespace is recommended for command operations: $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/EXEC/command_name An MQTT message published with this topic triggers the execution of the associated command. The EXEC message may contain properties in the MQTT payload that can be used to parameterize the command execution. MQTT Unsolicited Events IoT applications have the ability to send unsolicited messages to a remote server using events to periodically report data readings from their resources, or to report special events and observed conditions. Tip It is recommended to not use MQTT control topics for unsolicited events, and subsequently, to avoid the $EDC topic prefix. Event MQTT topics generally follow the pattern shown below to report unsolicited data observations for a given resource: account_name/client_id/app_id/resource_id Discoverability The MQTT namespace guidelines in this document do not address remote discoverability of a given device\u2019s applications and its resources. The described interaction pattern can be easily adopted to define an application whose only responsibility is reporting the device profile in terms of installed applications and available resources. Remote OSGi Management via MQTT The concepts previously described have been applied to develop a solution that allows for the remote management of certain aspects of an OSGi container through the MQTT protocol, including: Remote deployment of application bundles Remote start and stop of services Remote read and update of service configurations The following sections describe the MQTT topic namespaces and the application payloads used to achieve the remote management of an OSGi container via MQTT. Note For the scope of this document, some aspects concerning the encoding and compressing of the payload are not included. The applicability of the remote management solution, as inspired by the OSGi component model, can be extended beyond OSGi as the contract with the managing server based on MQTT topics and XML payloads. Remote OSGi ConfigurationAdmin Interactions via MQTT An application bundle is installed in the gateway to allow for remote management of the configuration properties of the services running in the OSGi container. For information about the OSGi Configuration Admin Service and the OSGi Meta Type Service, please refer to the OSGi Service Platform Service R7 Specifications . The app_id for the remote configuration service of an MQTT application is \u201c CONF-V1 \u201d. The resources it manages are the configuration properties of the OSGi services. Service configurations are represented in XML format. The following service configuration XML message is an example of a watchdog service: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?> <ns2:configuration xmlns:ns2= <http://eurotech.com/esf/2.0 xmlns= <http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/metatype/v1.2.0 > pid=\"org.eclipse.kura.watchdog.WatchdogService\"> <OCD id= \"org.eclipse.kura.watchdog.WatchdogService\" name= \"WatchdogService\" description= \"WatchdogService Configuration\" > <Icon resource= \"WatchdogService\" /> <AD id= \"watchdog.timeout\" name= \"watchdog.timeout\" required= \"true\" default= \"10000\" cardinality= \"0\" type= \"Integer\" description= \"\" /> </OCD> <ns2:properties> <ns2:property type= \"Integer\" array= \"false\" name= \"watchdog.timeout\" > <ns2:value> 10000 </ns2:value> </ns2:property> </ns2:properties> </ns2:configuration> The service configuration XML message is comprised of the following parts: The Object Class Definition (OCD), which describes the service attributes that may be configured. (The syntax of the OCD element is described in the OSGi Service Platform Service R7 Specifications ) The properties element, which contains one or more properties with their associated type and values. The type name must match the name provided in the corresponding attribute definition identifier (AD id) contained in the OCD. The \u201cCONF-V1\u201d application supports the read and update resource operations as described in the following sections. Read All Configurations This operation provides all service configurations for which remote administration is supported. Request Topic: $EDC/account_name/client_id/CONF-V1/GET/configurations Request Payload: Nothing application-specific beyond the request ID and requester client ID Response Payload: Configurations of all the registered services serialized in XML format Read Configuration for a Given Service This operation provides configurations for a specific service that is identified by an OSGi service persistent identifier pid .

Request Topic: $EDC/account_name/client_id/CONF-V1/PUT/configurations/pid Request Payload: Service configurations serialized in XML format Response Payload: Nothing application-specific Example Management Web Application The previously described read and update resource operations can be leveraged to develop a web application that allows for remote OSGi service configuration updates via MQTT though a web user-interface. The screen capture that follows shows an example administration application where, for a given IoT gateway, a list of all configurable services is presented to the administrator. When one such service is selected, a form is dynamically generated based on the metadata provided in the service OCD. This form includes logic to handle different attribute types, validate acceptable value ranges, and render optional values as drop-downs. When the form is submitted, the new values are communicated to the device through an MQTT resource update message. Remote OSGi DeploymentAdmin Interactions via MQTT An application is installed in the gateway to allow for the remote management of the deployment packages installed in the OSGi container. For information about the OSGi Deployment Admin Service, please refer to the OSGi Service Platform Service R7 Specifications . The app_id for the remote deployment service of an MQTT application is \u201c DEPLOY-V2 \u201d. The resources it manages are the packages deployed in the OSGi container. Deployment packages are represented in XML format. The following XML message is an example of a service deployment: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?> <packages> <package> <name> esf </name> <version> 1.0.0 </version> <bundles> <bundle> <name> org.hsqldb.hsqldb </name> <version> 2.2.9 </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.eclipse.kura.linux </name> <version> 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> javax.bluetooth </name> <version> 2.1.1 </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.eclipse.kura.protocol.modbus </name> <version> 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.apache.commons.net </name> <version> 3.1.0.v201205071737 </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> javax.usb.api </name> <version> 1.0.2 </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.apache.servicemix.bundles.protobuf-java </name> <version> 2.4.1.1 </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.eclipse.kura.protocol.pcn </name> <version> 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> javax.usb.common </name> <version> 1.0.2 </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.eclipse.kura.core </name> <version> 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.eclipse.kura.api </name> <version> 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.eclipse.kura.web </name> <version> 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> javax.comm </name> <version> 2.2.0 </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> org.eclipse.paho.mqtt-client </name> <version> 1.0.1.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> <bundle> <name> edc-client </name> <version> 2.1.0.SNAPSHOT </version> </bundle> </bundles> </package> </packages> The deployment package XML message is comprised of the following package elements: Symbolic name Version Bundles that are managed by the deployment package along with their symbolic name and version The \u201cDEPLOY-V2\u201d application supports the read , start/stop , and install/uninstall resource operations as described in the following sections.

section provides guidelines on how to structure the MQTT topic namespace for messaging interactions with applications running on IoT gateway devices. Interactions may be solicited by a remote server to the gateway using a request/response messaging model, or unsolicited when the gateway simply reports messages or events to a remote server based on periodic or event-driven patterns. The table below defines some basic terms used in this document: Term Description account_name Identifies a group of devices and users. It can be seen as partition of the MQTT topic namespace. For example, access control lists can be defined so that users are only given access to the child topics of a given account_name . client_id Identifies a single gateway device within an account (typically the MAC address of a gateway\u2019s primary network interface). The client_id maps to the Client Identifier (Client ID) as defined in the MQTT specifications. app_id Unique string identifier for application (e.g., \u201cCONF-V1\u201d, \u201cCONF-V2\u201d, etc.). resource_id Identifies a resource(s) that is owned and managed by a particular application. Management of resources (e.g., sensors, actuators, local files, or configuration options) includes listing them, reading the latest value, or updating them to a new value. A resource_id may be a hierarchical topic, where, for example, \u201csensors/temp\u201d may identify a temperature sensor and \u201csensor/hum\u201d a humidity sensor. A gateway, as identified by a specific client_id and belonging to a particular account_name , may have one or more applications running on it (e.g., \u201capp_id1\u201d, \u201capp_id2\u201d, etc.). Each application can manage one or more resources identified by a distinct resource_id (s). Based on this criterion, an IoT application running on an IoT gateway may be viewed in terms of the resources it owns and manages as well as the unsolicited events it reports.","title":"MQTT Namespace"},{"location":"references/mqtt-namespace/#mqtt-requestresponse-conversations","text":"Solicited interactions require a request/response message pattern to be established over MQTT. To initiate a solicited conversation, a remote server first sends a request message to a given application running on a specific device and then waits for a response. To ensure the delivery of request messages, applications that support request/response conversations via MQTT should subscribe to the following topic on startup: $EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/# The $EDC prefix is used to mark topics that are used as control topics for remote management. This prefix distinguishes control topics from data topics that are used in unsolicited reports and marks the associated messages as transient (not to be stored in the historical data archive, if present). Note While Kura currently requires \u201c$EDC\u201d as the prefix for control topics, this prefix may change in the future for the following reasons: MQTT 3.1.1 discourages the use of topic starting with \u201c$\u201d for application purposes. As a binding of LWM2M over MQTT is taking shape, it would make sense to use a topic prefix for management messages like \u201cLWM2M\u201d or similar abbreviations (e.g. \"LW2\u201d, \u201cLWM\u201d). A requester (i.e., the remote server) initiates a request/response conversation through the following events: Generating a conversation identifier known as a request.id (e.g., by concatenating a random number to a timestamp) Subscribing to the topic where the response message will be published, where requester.client.id is the client ID of the requester, such as: $EDC/account_name/requester.client.id/app_id/REPLY/request.id Sending the request message to the appropriate application-specific topic with the following fields in the payload: request.id (identifier used to match a response with a request) requester.client.id (client ID of the requester) The application receives the request, processes it, and responds on a REPLY topic structured as: $EDC/account_name/requester.client.id/app_id/REPLY/request.id Note While this recommendation does not mandate the format of the message payload, which is application-specific, it is important that the request.id and requester.client.id fields are included in the payload. Kura leverages an MQTT payload encoded through Google Protocol Buffers. Kura includes the request.id and the requester.client.id as two named metrics of the Request messages. The Kura payload definition can be found here . Once the response for a given request is received, the requester unsubscribes from the REPLY topic.","title":"MQTT Request/Response Conversations"},{"location":"references/mqtt-namespace/#mqtt-requestresponse-example","text":"The following sample request/response conversation shows the device configuration being provided for an application: account_name: guest device client_id: F0:D2:F1:C4:53:DB app_id: CONF-V1 Remote Service Requester client_id: 00:E0:C7:01:02:03 The remote server publishes a request message similar to the following: Request Topic: $EDC/guest/F0:D2:F1:C4:53:DB/CONF-V1/GET/configurations Request Payload: request.id: 1363603920892-8078887174204257595 requester.client.id: 00:E0:C7:01:02:03 The gateway device replies with a response message similar to the following: Response Topic: $EDC/guest/00:E0:C7:01:02:03/CONF-V1/REPLY/1363603920892-8078887174204257595 Response Payload, where the following properties are mandatory: response.code Possible response code values include: 200 (RESPONSE_CODE_OK) 400 (RESPONSE_CODE_BAD_REQUEST) 404 (RESPONSE_CODE_NOTFOUND) 500 (RESPONSE_CODE_ERROR) response.exception.message (value is null or an exception message) response.exception.message (value is null or an exception stack trace) Note In addition to the mandatory properties, the response payload may also have custom properties whose description is beyond the scope of this document.
